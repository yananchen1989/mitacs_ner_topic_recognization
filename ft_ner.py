## **Fine-tuning BERT for named-entity recognition**

In this notebook, we are going to use **BertForTokenClassification** which is included in the [Transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) by HuggingFace. This model has BERT as its base architecture, with a token classification head on top, allowing it to make predictions at the token level, rather than the sequence level. Named entity recognition is typically treated as a token classification problem, so that's what we are going to use it for.

This tutorial uses the idea of **transfer learning**, i.e. first pretraining a large neural network in an unsupervised way, and then fine-tuning that neural network on a task of interest. In this case, BERT is a neural network pretrained on 2 tasks: masked language modeling and next sentence prediction. Now, we are going to fine-tune this network on a NER dataset. Fine-tuning is supervised learning, so this means we will need a labeled dataset.

If you want to know more about BERT, I suggest the following resources:
* the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)
* Jay Allamar's [blog post](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/) as well as his [tutorial](http://jalammar.github.io/a-visual-guide-to-using-bert-for-the-first-time/)
* Chris Mccormick's [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoRX98PLOsaN8PtekB9kWrw)
* Abbishek Kumar Mishra's [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/abhisheksvnit)

The following notebook largely follows the same structure as the tutorials by Abhishek Kumar Mishra. For his tutorials on the Transformers library, see his [Github repository](https://github.com/abhimishra91/transformers-tutorials).

NOTE: this notebook assumes basic knowledge about deep learning, BERT, and native PyTorch. If you want to learn more Python, deep learning and PyTorch, I highly recommend cs231n by Stanford University and the FastAI course by Jeremy Howard et al. Both are freely available on the web.  

Now, let's move on to the real stuff!

#### **Importing Python Libraries and preparing the environment**

This notebook assumes that you have the following libraries installed:
* pandas
* numpy
* sklearn
* pytorch
* transformers
* seqeval

As we are running this in Google Colab, the only libraries we need to additionally install are transformers and seqeval (GPU version):
"""
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import torch, argparse, random
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
from transformers import BertTokenizerFast, BertConfig, BertForTokenClassification
from sklearn.metrics import * 
"""As deep learning can be accellerated a lot using a GPU instead of a CPU, make sure you can run this notebook in a GPU runtime (which Google Colab provides for free! - check "Runtime" - "Change runtime type" - and set the hardware accelerator to "GPU").

We can set the default device to GPU using the following code (if it prints "cuda", it means the GPU has been recognized):
"""
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument("--gpu", default="3", type=str)
args = parser.parse_args()

from torch import cuda
device = 'cuda:{}'.format(args.gpu) if cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'
print(device)

"""#### **Downloading and preprocessing the data**
Named entity recognition (NER) uses a specific annotation scheme, which is defined (at least for European languages) at the *word* level. An annotation scheme that is widely used is called **[IOB-tagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside%E2%80%93outside%E2%80%93beginning_(tagging)**, which stands for Inside-Outside-Beginning. Each tag indicates whether the corresponding word is *inside*, *outside* or at the *beginning* of a specific named entity. The reason this is used is because named entities usually comprise more than 1 word. 

Let's have a look at an example. If you have a sentence like "Barack Obama was born in Hawa√Ø", 
then the corresponding tags would be   [B-PERS, I-PERS, O, O, O, B-GEO]. 
B-PERS means that the word "Barack" is the beginning of a person, 
I-PERS means that the word "Obama" is inside a person, 
"O" means that the word "was" is outside a named entity, and so on. 
So one typically has as many tags as there are words in a sentence.

So if you want to train a deep learning model for NER, 
it requires that you have your data in this IOB format 
(or similar formats such as [BILOU](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17116446/what-do-the-bilou-tags-mean-in-named-entity-recognition)). There exist many annotation tools which let you create these kind of annotations automatically (such as Spacy's [Prodigy](https://prodi.gy/), 
[Tagtog](https://docs.tagtog.net/) or [Doccano](https://github.com/doccano/doccano)). You can also use Spacy's [biluo_tags_from_offsets](https://spacy.io/api/goldparse#biluo_tags_from_offsets) function to convert annotations at the character level to IOB format.

Here, we will use a NER dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/namanj27/ner-dataset) 
that is already in IOB format. One has to go to this web page, download the dataset, 
unzip it, and upload the csv file to this notebook. Let's print out the first few rows of this csv file:
"""

data = pd.read_csv("/scratch/w/wluyliu/yananc/ner_datasetreference.csv", encoding='unicode_escape')
data.head()
data.count()

"""As we can see, there are approximately 48,000 sentences in the dataset, 
comprising more than 1 million words and tags (quite huge!). This corresponds to approximately 20 words per sentence. 

Let's have a look at the different NER tags, and their frequency: 
"""

print("Number of tags: {}".format(len(data.Tag.unique())))
frequencies = data.Tag.value_counts()
frequencies

"""There are 8 category tags, each with a "beginning" and "inside" variant, and the "outside" tag. 
It is not really clear what these tags mean - "geo" probably stands for geographical entity, 
"gpe" for geopolitical entity, and so on.
 They do not seem to correspond with what the publisher says on Kaggle.
  Some tags seem to be underrepresented. Let's print them by frequency (highest to lowest): """

tags = {}
for tag, count in zip(frequencies.index, frequencies):
    if tag != "O":
        if tag[2:5] not in tags.keys():
            tags[tag[2:5]] = count
        else:
            tags[tag[2:5]] += count
    continue

print(sorted(tags.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True))

"""Let's remove "art", "eve" and "nat" named entities, 
as performance on them will probably be not comparable to the other named entities. """

entities_to_remove = ["B-art", "I-art", "B-eve", "I-eve", "B-nat", "I-nat"]
data = data[~data.Tag.isin(entities_to_remove)]
data.head()

"""We create 2 dictionaries: 
one that maps individual tags to indices, 
and one that maps indices to their individual tags.

labels_to_ids = {k: v for v, k in enumerate(data.Tag.unique())}
ids_to_labels = {v: k for v, k in enumerate(data.Tag.unique())}
labels_to_ids

"""As we can see, there are now only 10 different NER tags.

Now, we have to ask ourself the question: what is a training example in the case of NER, 
which is provided in a single forward pass? 

A training example is typically a **sentence**, with corresponding IOB tags.
 Let's group the words and corresponding tags by sentence:
"""

# let's also create a new column called "word_labels" which groups the tags by sentence 
data['word_labels'] = data[['Sentence #','Word','Tag']].groupby(['Sentence #'])['Tag'].transform(lambda x: ','.join(x))
data.head()

"""Let's only keep the "sentence" and "word_labels" columns, and drop duplicates:"""

data = data[["sentence", "word_labels"]].drop_duplicates().reset_index(drop=True)
data.head()

len(data)

"""Let's verify that a random sentence and its corresponding tags are correct:"""

data.iloc[41].sentence

data.iloc[41].word_labels

"""#### **Preparing the dataset and dataloader**

Now that our data is preprocessed, we can turn it into PyTorch tensors such that we can provide it to the model. Let's start by defining some key variables that will be used later on in the training/evaluation process:
"""

MAX_LEN = 64
TRAIN_BATCH_SIZE = 32
VALID_BATCH_SIZE = 32
LEARNING_RATE = 1e-05
MAX_GRAD_NORM = 10
tokenizer = BertTokenizerFast.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased',\
     cache_dir='/scratch/w/wluyliu/yananc/cache', local_files_only=True)

"""A tricky part of NER with BERT is that BERT relies on **wordpiece tokenization**, rather than word tokenization. 
This means that we should also define the labels at the wordpiece-level, rather than the word-level! 

For example, if you have word like "Washington" which is labeled as "b-gpe", 
but it gets tokenized to "Wash", "##ing", "##ton", 
then one approach could be to handle this by only train the model on the tag labels for the first word piece token of a word 
(i.e. only label "Wash" with "b-gpe").
 This is what was done in the original BERT paper, see Github discussion [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/64#issuecomment-443703063).

Note that this is a **design decision**. 
You could also decide to propagate the original label of the word to all of its word pieces 
and let the model train on this. 
In that case, the model should be able to produce the correct labels for each individual wordpiece.
 This was done in [this NER tutorial with BERT](https://github.com/chambliss/Multilingual_NER/blob/master/python/utils/main_utils.py#L118). Another design decision could be to give the first wordpiece of each word the original word label, and then use the label ‚ÄúX‚Äù for all subsequent subwords of that word. All of them seem to lead to good performance.

Below, we define a regular PyTorch [dataset class](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html) 
(which transforms examples of a dataframe to PyTorch tensors). 
Here, each sentence gets tokenized, the special tokens that BERT expects are added, 
the tokens are padded or truncated based on the max length of the model,
 the attention mask is created and the labels are created based on the dictionary which we defined above.
  Word pieces that should be ignored have a label of -100
   (which is the default `ignore_index` of PyTorch's [CrossEntropyLoss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html)).

For more information about BERT's inputs, see [here](https://huggingface.co/transformers/glossary.html).

"""#### **Training the model**

Before training the model, let's perform a sanity check, which I learned thanks to Andrej Karpathy's wonderful 
[cs231n course](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) at Stanford (see also his [blog post about debugging neural networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/)). 
The initial loss of your model should be close to -ln(1/number of classes) = -ln(1/17) = 2.83. 

Why? Because we are using cross entropy loss. 
The cross entropy loss is defined as -ln(probability score of the model for the correct class). 
In the beginning, the weights are random, so the probability distribution 
for all of the classes for a given token will be uniform, 
meaning that the probability for the correct class will be near 1/17. 
The loss for a given token will thus be -ln(1/17). 
As PyTorch's [CrossEntropyLoss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html) 
(which is used by `BertForTokenClassification`) uses *mean reduction* by default, 
it will compute the mean loss for each of the tokens in the sequence for which a label is provided. 

Let's verify this:

Here, we use the prediction of the **first word piece of every word** (which is how the model was trained). 

*In other words, the code below does not take into account when predictions of different word pieces 
that belong to the same word do not match.*
