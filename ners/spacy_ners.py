The Josephson junction quantum computer was demonstrated in 1999 by Nakamura
and the coworkers. In this computer a Cooper pair box, which is a small superconducting
island electrode is weakly coupled to a bulk superconductor. Weak coupling between the
superconductors create a Josephson junction between them which behaves as a capacitor.
If the Cooper box is small as a quantum dot, the charging current breaks into discrete
transfer of individual Cooper pairs, so that ultimately it is possible to just transfer a single
Cooper pair across the junction. Like quantum dot, computers in Josephson junction
computers, qubits are controlled electrically. Josephson junctionâ€™s quantum computers
are one of the promising candidates for future developments.
