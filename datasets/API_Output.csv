computer science, mathematics, physical sciences and engineering. They will
likely lead to a new wave of technological innovations in communication,
computation and cryptography. As the theory of quantum physics is fundamentally
stochastic, randomness and uncertainty are deeply rooted in quantum
computation, quantum simulation and quantum information. Consequently quantum
algorithms are random in nature, and quantum simulation utilizes Monte Carlo
techniques extensively. Thus statistics can play an important role in quantum
computation and quantum simulation, which in turn offer great potential to
revolutionize computational statistics. While only pseudo-random numbers can be
generated by classical computers, quantum computers are able to produce genuine
random numbers; quantum computers can exponentially or quadratically speed up
median evaluation, Monte Carlo integration and Markov chain simulation. This
paper gives a brief review on quantum computation, quantum simulation and
quantum information. We introduce the basic concepts of quantum computation and
quantum simulation and present quantum algorithms that are known to be much
faster than the available classic algorithms. We provide a statistical
framework for the analysis of quantum algorithms and quantum simulation."

in focussing both experimental and theoretical research in quantum information
processing. These criteria were formulated specifically for the circuit model

question is therefore what are the general criteria for implementing quantum
computers. To this end, a formal operational definition of a quantum computer
is introduced. It is then shown that according to this definition a device is a
quantum computer if it obeys the following four criteria: Any quantum computer
must (1) have a quantum memory; (2) facilitate a controlled quantum evolution
of the quantum memory; (3) include a method for cooling the quantum memory; and
(4) provide a readout mechanism for subsets of the quantum memory. The criteria
are met when the device is scalable and operates fault-tolerantly. We discuss

selected measurements on individual qubits that form the cluster state. We
describe in detail how a scalable quantum computer can be constructed using

melting, strong quantum entropy growth and destruction of computer operability.
The time scales for development of quantum chaos and ergodicity are determined.
In spite the fact that this phenomenon is rather dangerous for quantum
computing it is shown that the quantum chaos border for inter-qubit coupling is
exponentially larger than the energy level spacing between quantum computer
eigenstates and drops only linearly with the number of qubits n. As a result
the ideal multi-qubit structure of the computer remains rather robust against
imperfections. This opens a broad parameter region for a possible realization

is a moving quantum computer passing through a double-slit. A duality computer
offers the capability to perform separate operations on the sub-waves coming

A $n$-qubit quantum computer can be used as an $n$-bit reversible classical
computer and is energy efficient. Our result further enables a $(n+1)$-qubit
quantum computer to run classical algorithms in a $O(2^n)$-bit classical

performing measurement-based quantum computation exist: the one-way quantum
computer was introduced by Briegel and Raussendorf, and quantum computation via
projective measurements only by Nielsen. The more recent development of this
second model is based on state transfers instead of teleportation. From this
development, a finite but approximate quantum universal family of observables
is exhibited, which includes only one two-qubit observable, while others are
one-qubit observables. In this article, an infinite but exact quantum universal
family of observables is proposed, including also only one two-qubit

dynamics to speed up a quantum computation lies in the unique ability of the
unitary quantum dynamics to build the effective interaction between the
symmetric structure of the Hilbert space of the quantum system and the
mathematical symmetric structure of a problem to be solved on the quantum
system. This unique ability could result in an essential difference of
computational power between quantum and classical computations by combining the
symmetric structure and property of the Hilbert space. The new
quantum-computing speedup theory also provides reasonable mechanisms for
exponential quantum-computing speedup for the existing efficient quantum
algorithms based on the quantum parallel principle. These existing quantum
algorithms including the hidden-subgroup-problem quantum algorithms and
conventional quantum search algorithms have the common character that the
symmetric structure of the Hilbert space does not have any effective effect on
these quantum algorithms. This could be the main reason why these quantum
algorithms are quite special and considered to be semiclassical."

from helping to preventing spies from reading private communications. Among the

an NP optimization problem that searches an optimal value among
exponentially-many outcomes of polynomial-time computations. This paper expands
his framework to a quantum optimization problem using polynomial-time quantum
computations and introduces the notion of an ``universal'' quantum optimization
problem similar to a classical ``complete'' optimization problem. We exhibit a
canonical quantum optimization problem that is universal for the class of
polynomial-time quantum optimization problems. We show in a certain relativized
world that all quantum optimization problems cannot be approximated closely by
quantum polynomial-time computations. We also study the complexity of quantum
optimization problems in connection to well-known complexity classes."

and to process tasks far faster than those of conventional classical computers.
In this paper we show a new road towards building fault tolerance quantum
computer by tuning quantum tunneling effect of the degenerate quantum states in
topological order, instead of by braiding anyons. Using a designer Hamiltonian
- the Wen-Plaquette model as an example, we study its quantum tunneling effect
of the toric codes and show how to control the toric code to realize
topological quantum computation (TQC). In particular, we give a proposal to the
measurement of TQC. In the end the realization of the Wen-Plaquette model in
cold atoms is discussed."

  quantum networks",2021-06-17,2021-11-05,Don Towsley,"Quantum networks are complex systems formed by the interaction among quantum
processors through quantum channels. Analogous to classical computer networks,
quantum networks allow for the distribution of quantum computation among
quantum computers. In this work, we describe a quantum walk protocol to perform
distributed quantum computing in a quantum network. The protocol uses a quantum
walk as a quantum control signal to perform distributed quantum operations. We
consider a generalization of the discrete-time coined quantum walk model that
accounts for the interaction between a quantum walker system in the network
graph with quantum registers inside the network nodes. The protocol logically
captures distributed quantum computing, abstracting hardware implementation and
the transmission of quantum information through channels. Control signal
transmission is mapped to the propagation of the walker system across the
network, while interactions between the control layer and the quantum registers
are embedded into the application of coin operators. We demonstrate how to use
the quantum walker system to perform a distributed CNOT operation, which shows
the universality of the protocol for distributed quantum computing.
Furthermore, we apply the protocol to the task of entanglement distribution in
a quantum network."

Turing machine and orthomodular lattice-valued automata. These models are
useful for determining the expressive power and boundaries of various
computational features. In light of the current state of quantum computation
theory research, a systematic review of the literature seems timely. This

applications, quantum computation and algorithms, quantum communication
protocol, and universal quantum computation for quantum engineers, researchers,
and scientists, we will discuss and summarized the core principles and
practical application areas of quantum computation. We first discuss the
historical prospect from which quantum computing emerged from the early days of
computing before the dominance of modern microprocessors. And the re-emergence
of that quest with the sunset of Moore's law in the current decade. The mapping
of computation onto the behavior of physical systems is a historical challenge
vividly illustrate by considering how quantum bits may be realized with a wide
variety of physical systems, spanning from atoms to photons, using
semiconductors and superconductors. The computing algorithms also change with
the underline variety of physical systems and the possibility of encoding the
information in the quantum systems compared to the ordinary classical computers
because of these new abilities afforded by quantum systems. We will also
consider the emerging engineering, science, technology, business, and social
implications of these advancements. We will describe a substantial difference
between quantum and classical computation paradigm. After we will discuss and
understand engineering challenges currently faced by developers of the real
quantum computation system. We will evaluate the essential technology required
for quantum computers to be able to function correctly. Later on, discuss the
potential business application, which can be touch by these new computation
capabilities. We utilize the IBM Quantum Experience to run the real-world

computation. It provides both a framework for formulating quantum algorithms
and an architecture for the physical construction of quantum computers.
However, several other models of quantum computation exist which provide useful
alternative frameworks for both discovering new quantum algorithms and devising
new physical implementations of quantum computers. In this thesis, I first
present necessary background material for a general physics audience and
discuss existing models of quantum computation. Then, I present three results
relating to various models of quantum computation: a scheme for improving the
intrinsic fault tolerance of adiabatic quantum computers using quantum error
detecting codes, a proof that a certain problem of estimating Jones polynomials
is complete for the one clean qubit complexity class, and a generalization of
perturbative gadgets which allows k-body interactions to be directly simulated

communications functionalities provided by the Quantum Internet, remote quantum
processing units (QPUs) can communicate and cooperate for executing
computational tasks that single NISQ devices cannot handle by themselves. To
this aim, distributed quantum computing requires a new generation of quantum
compilers, for mapping any quantum algorithm to any distributed quantum
computing architecture. With this perspective, in this paper, we first discuss
the main challenges arising with compiler design for distributed quantum
computing. Then, we analytically derive an upper bound of the overhead induced
by quantum compilation for distributed quantum computing. The derived bound
accounts for the overhead induced by the underlying computing architecture as
well as the additional overhead induced by the sub-optimal quantum compiler --
expressly designed through the paper to achieve three key features, namely,
general-purpose, efficient and effective. Finally, we validate the analytical
results and we confirm the validity of the compiler design through an extensive
performance analysis."
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0302153v1,A prime factorization based on quantum dynamics on a spin ensemble (I),2003-02-20,2003-02-20,Xijia Miao,"In this paper it has been described how to use the unitary dynamics of
quantum mechanics to solve the prime factorization problem on a spin ensemble
without any quantum entanglement. The ensemble quantum computation for the
prime factorization is based on the basic principle that both a closed quantum
system and its ensemble obey the same unitary dynamics of quantum mechanics if
there is not any decoherence effect in both the quantum system and its
ensemble. It uses the NMR multiple-quantum measurement techniques to output the
quantum computational results that are the inphase multiple-quantum spectra of
the spin ensemble. It has been shown that the inphase NMR multiple-quantum
spectral intensities used to search for the period of the modular exponential
function may reduce merely in a polynomial form as the qubit number of the spin
ensemble. The time evolution process of the modular exponential operation on
the quantum computer obeys the unitary dynamics of quantum mechanics and hence
the computational output is governed by the quantum dynamics. This essential
difference between the quantum computer and the classical one could be the key
point for the quantum computation outperforming the classical one in the prime
factorization on a spin ensemble without any quantum entanglement. It has been
shown that the prime factorization based on the quantum dynamics on a spin
ensemble is locally efficient at least. This supports the conjecture that the
quantum dynamics could play an important role for the origin of power of
quantum computation and quantum entanglement could not be a unique resource to
achieve power of quantum computation in the prime factorization."
