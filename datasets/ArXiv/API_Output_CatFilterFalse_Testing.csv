  Microphones",2021-12-24,Shao-fu Shih,"Voice communication using the air conduction microphone in noisy environments
suffers from the degradation of speech audibility. Bone conduction microphones
(BCM) are robust against ambient noises but suffer from limited effective
bandwidth due to their sensing mechanism. Although existing audio super
resolution algorithms can recover the high frequency loss to achieve
high-fidelity audio, they require considerably more computational resources
than available in low-power hearable devices. This paper proposes the
first-ever real-time on-chip speech audio super resolution system for BCM. To
accomplish this, we built and compared a series of lightweight audio super
resolution deep learning models. Among all these models, ATS-UNet is the most
cost-efficient because the proposed novel Audio Temporal Shift Module (ATSM)
reduces the network's dimensionality while maintaining sufficient temporal
features from speech audios. Then we quantized and deployed the ATS-UNet to
low-end ARM micro-controller units for real-time embedded prototypes.
Evaluation results show that our system achieved real-time inference speed on
Cortex-M7 and higher quality than the baseline audio super resolution method.
Finally, we conducted a user study with ten experts and ten amateur listeners
to evaluate our method's effectiveness to human ears. Both groups perceived a
significantly higher speech quality with our method when compared to the
solutions with the original BCM or air conduction microphone with cutting-edge
noise reduction algorithms.",cs.SD,cat:quant-ph,all:super%20conducting

http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0205036v2,Super-conducting critical fields and anisotropy of a MgB2 single crystal,2002-05-02,A. D. Caplin,"Despite the intense activity in the year since the discovery of
superconductivity in MgB2, key parameters, in particular the upper and lower
critical fields Hc2 and Hc1 and their anisotropies, are not well-established,
largely because of the difficulty of growing MgB2 crystals. Attempts have been
made to deduce these parameters from experiments on polycrystalline material,
but they have substantial uncertainties. Hc2 is particularly important for
applications, as it is the field which quenches bulk super-conductivity. In
terms of understanding MgB2, it is now clear that the conventional
electron-phonon interaction is strong enough to account for the high transition
temperature Tc, but the consequences of the double super-conducting gap for the
anisotropy and its dependence on temperature, are uncertain. Here we describe
detailed direct measurements of Hc1(T) and Hc2(T) for the two principal
crystallographic directions in a clean single crystal of MgB2. For fields in
the c-direction, $\mu_0 H^c_{c1}(0)$ = $0.28 +- 0.01T$ and $\mu_0 H^c_{c2}(0)$
is $3 +- 0.5T$; this ratio of critical fields is rather low and implies that
MgB2 is only just a Type II super-conductor. The anisotropies of both critical
fields are close to 2.",cond-mat.supr-con,cat:quant-ph,"all:""super%20conduct"""
