http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06078v1,A Note on the Post-Quantum Security of (Ring) Signatures,2021-12-11,Giulio Malavolta,"This work revisits the security of classical signatures and ring signatures
in a quantum world. For (ordinary) signatures, we focus on the arguably
preferable security notion of blind-unforgeability recently proposed by Alagic
et al. (Eurocrypt'20). We present two short signature schemes achieving this
notion: one is in the quantum random oracle model, assuming quantum hardness of
SIS; and the other is in the plain model, assuming quantum hardness of LWE with
super-polynomial modulus. Prior to this work, the only known blind-unforgeable
schemes are Lamport's one-time signature and the Winternitz one-time signature,
and both of them are in the quantum random oracle model.
  For ring signatures, the recent work by Chatterjee et al. (Crypto'21)
proposes a definition trying to capture adversaries with quantum access to the
signer. However, it is unclear if their definition, when restricted to the
classical world, is as strong as the standard security notion for ring
signatures. They also present a construction that only partially achieves
(even) this seeming weak definition, in the sense that the adversary can only
conduct superposition attacks over the messages, but not the rings. We propose
a new definition that does not suffer from the above issue. Our definition is
an analog to the blind-unforgeability in the ring signature setting. Moreover,
assuming the quantum hardness of LWE, we construct a compiler converting any
blind-unforgeable (ordinary) signatures to a ring signature satisfying our
definition.",quant-ph,cat:quant-ph,all:super%20conduct

http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00286v1,Blocking-state influence on shot noise and conductance in quantum dots,2017-12-31,C. Schönenberger,"Quantum dots (QDs) investigated through electron transport measurements often
exhibit varying, state-dependent tunnel couplings to the leads. Under specific
conditions, weakly coupled states can result in a strong suppression of the
electrical current and they are correspondingly called blocking states. Using
the combination of conductance and shot noise measurements, we investigate
blocking states in carbon nanotube (CNT) QDs. We report negative differential
conductance and super-Poissonian noise. The enhanced noise is the signature of
electron bunching, which originates from random switches between the strongly
and weakly conducting states of the QD. Negative differential conductance
appears here when the blocking state is an excited state. In this case, at the
threshold voltage where the blocking state becomes populated, the current is
reduced. Using a master equation approach, we provide numerical simulations
reproducing both the conductance and the shot noise pattern observed in our

(QED) has been used to construct universal quantum entangling gates on
superconducting resonators in previous works. It is a second-order coupling
effect between the resonator and the qubit in the dispersive regime, which
leads to a slow state-selective rotation on the qubit. Here, we present two
proposals to construct the fast universal quantum gates on superconducting
resonators in a microwave-photon quantum processor composed of multiple
superconducting resonators coupled to a superconducting transmon qutrit, that
is, the controlled-phase (c-phase) gate on two microwave-photon resonators and
the controlled-controlled phase (cc-phase) gates on three resonators, resorting
to quantum resonance operations, without any drive field. Compared with
previous works, our universal quantum gates have the higher fidelities and
shorter operation times in theory. The numerical simulation shows that the
fidelity of our c-phase gate is 99.57% within about 38.1 ns and that of our

magnetic interaction, to a small number (perhaps single), of electronic spins.
By choosing the electronic spin to be within a Nitrogen Vacancy centre in
diamond one can perform optical readout, polarization and control of this
electron spin using microwave and radio frequency irradiation. More
importantly, by utilising Nitrogen Vacancy centres with nearby 13C nuclei,
using this interconnect, one has the potential build a quantum device where the
nuclear spin qubits are connected over centimeter distances via the Nitrogen
Vacancy electronic spins interacting through the superconducting bus.",quant-ph,cat:quant-ph,all:superconduct

and thermal conductivity of a rod- or filament-like specimen using a way
similar to a four-probe resistance measurement. The specimen in this method
needs to be electrically conductive and with a temperature-dependent
resistance, for acting both as a heater to create a temperature fluctuation and
as a sensor to measure its thermal response. With this method we have
successfully measured the specific heat and thermal conductivity of platinum
wire specimens at cryogenic temperatures, and measured those thermal quantities
of tiny carbon nanotube bundles some of which are only 10^-9 g in mass.",quant-ph,cat:quant-ph,all:super+conduct

a narrow electron channel in an AlGaAs/GaAs 2-dimensional electron gas. Given
that the electron channel is 1-dimensional, the photo-induced conductance has
plateaus at multiples of the quantum conductance 2e$^{2}$/h. Super-imposed on
these broad conductance plateaus are many sharp, small, conductance steps
associated with single-photon absorption events that produce individual
photo-carriers. This type of photoconductive detector could measure a single
photon, while safely storing and protecting the spin degree of freedom of its
photo-carrier. This function is valuable for a quantum repeater that would
allow very long distance teleportation of quantum information.",quant-ph,cat:quant-ph,all:super%20conduct
