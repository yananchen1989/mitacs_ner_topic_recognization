`conventional' quantum computers."

reformulating finite quantum systems via Connes' noncommutative geometry. In
this formulation, quantum states are represented as noncommutative connections,
while gauge transformations on the connections play a role of unitary quantum
operations. Thereby, a geometrical model for quantum computation is presented,
which is equivalent to the quantum circuit model. This result shows a geometric
way of realizing quantum computing and as such, provides an alternative
proposal of building a quantum computer."

computer science, mathematics, physical sciences and engineering. They will
likely lead to a new wave of technological innovations in communication,
computation and cryptography. As the theory of quantum physics is fundamentally
stochastic, randomness and uncertainty are deeply rooted in quantum
computation, quantum simulation and quantum information. Consequently quantum
algorithms are random in nature, and quantum simulation utilizes Monte Carlo
techniques extensively. Thus statistics can play an important role in quantum
computation and quantum simulation, which in turn offer great potential to
revolutionize computational statistics. While only pseudo-random numbers can be
generated by classical computers, quantum computers are able to produce genuine
random numbers; quantum computers can exponentially or quadratically speed up
median evaluation, Monte Carlo integration and Markov chain simulation. This
paper gives a brief review on quantum computation, quantum simulation and
quantum information. We introduce the basic concepts of quantum computation and
quantum simulation and present quantum algorithms that are known to be much
faster than the available classic algorithms. We provide a statistical
framework for the analysis of quantum algorithms and quantum simulation."

  Computing in Closed Systems",2016-10-08,2016-10-08,Yong Wang,"We have unified quantum and classical computing in open quantum systems
called qACP which is a quantum generalization of process algebra ACP. But, an
axiomatization for quantum and classical processes with an assumption of closed
quantum systems is still missing. For closed quantum systems, unitary operator,
quantum measurement and quantum entanglement are three basic components for
quantum computing. This leads to probability unavoidable. Along the solution of
qACP to unify quantum and classical computing in open quantum systems, we unify
quantum and classical computing with an assumption of closed systems under the
framework of ACP-like probabilistic process algebra. This unification make it
can be used widely in verification for quantum and classical computing mixed
systems, such as most quantum communication protocols."

fundamental notions: polynomial-time quantum computations, the efficient
verification of quantum proofs, and quantum interactive proof systems.
Properties of quantum complexity classes based on these notions, such as BQP,

quantum advice, space-bounded quantum computation, and bounded-depth quantum
circuits, are also discussed."

Distinctly, the generalized quantum gates, the basic evolution operators in a
duality quantum computer are no longer unitary, and they can be expressed in
terms of linear combinations of unitary operators. All linear bounded operators
can be realized in a duality quantum computer, and unitary operators are just
the extreme points of the set of generalized quantum gates. A d-slits duality
quantum computer can be realized in an ordinary quantum computer with an
additional qudit using the duality quantum computing mode. Duality quantum
computer provides flexibility and clear physical picture in designing quantum
algorithms, serving as a useful bridge between quantum and classical
algorithms. In this review, we will show that duality quantum computer can
simulate quantum systems more efficiently than ordinary quantum computers by
providing descriptions of the recent efficient quantum simulation algorithms of
Childs et al [Quantum Information & Computation, 12(11-12): 901-924 (2012)] for
the fast simulation of quantum systems with a sparse Hamiltonian, and the
quantum simulation algorithm by Berry et al [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 090502
(2015)], which provides exponential improvement in precision for simulating
systems with a sparse Hamiltonian."
