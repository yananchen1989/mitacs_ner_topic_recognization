provides a unique 360 degrees overview of quantum technologies from science and
technology to geopolitical and societal issues. It covers quantum physics
history, quantum physics 101, gate-based quantum computing, quantum computing
engineering, quantum computing hardware and vendors, quantum enabling
technologies, quantum computing algorithms, software development tools and use
cases, quantum telecommunications and cryptography, quantum sensing, quantum
technologies around the world, quantum technologies societal impact and even
quantum fake sciences. The main audience are computer science engineers,
developers and IT specialists as well as quantum scientists and students who
want to acquire a global view of how quantum technologies work, and
particularly quantum computing."
http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.4939v1,Geometrical perspective on quantum states and quantum computation,2013-11-20,Zeqian Chen,"We interpret quantum computing as a geometric evolution process by
reformulating finite quantum systems via Connes' noncommutative geometry. In
this formulation, quantum states are represented as noncommutative connections,
while gauge transformations on the connections play a role of unitary quantum
operations. Thereby, a geometrical model for quantum computation is presented,
which is equivalent to the quantum circuit model. This result shows a geometric
way of realizing quantum computing and as such, provides an alternative
proposal of building a quantum computer."

computer science, mathematics, physical sciences and engineering. They will
likely lead to a new wave of technological innovations in communication,
computation and cryptography. As the theory of quantum physics is fundamentally
stochastic, randomness and uncertainty are deeply rooted in quantum
computation, quantum simulation and quantum information. Consequently quantum
algorithms are random in nature, and quantum simulation utilizes Monte Carlo
techniques extensively. Thus statistics can play an important role in quantum
computation and quantum simulation, which in turn offer great potential to
revolutionize computational statistics. While only pseudo-random numbers can be
generated by classical computers, quantum computers are able to produce genuine
random numbers; quantum computers can exponentially or quadratically speed up
median evaluation, Monte Carlo integration and Markov chain simulation. This
paper gives a brief review on quantum computation, quantum simulation and
quantum information. We introduce the basic concepts of quantum computation and
quantum simulation and present quantum algorithms that are known to be much
faster than the available classic algorithms. We provide a statistical
framework for the analysis of quantum algorithms and quantum simulation."

devices, including fermionic quantum computers and computers that exploit
nonlinear quantum mechanics. It is shown that unconventional quantum computing
devices can in principle compute some quantities more rapidly than
`conventional' quantum computers."
