  Circuits",2022-02-03,Owen Lockwood,"Quantum Variational Circuits (QVCs) are often claimed as one of the most
potent uses of both near term and long term quantum hardware. The standard
approaches to optimizing these circuits rely on a classical system to compute
the new parameters at every optimization step. However, this process can be
extremely challenging both in terms of navigating the exponentially scaling
complex Hilbert space, barren plateaus, and the noise present in all
foreseeable quantum hardware. Although a variety of optimization algorithms are
employed in practice, there is often a lack of theoretical or empirical
motivations for this choice. To this end we empirically evaluate the potential
of many common gradient and gradient free optimizers on a variety of
optimization tasks. These tasks include both classical and quantum data based
optimization routines. Our evaluations were conducted in both noise free and
noisy simulations. The large number of problems and optimizers yields strong
empirical guidance for choosing optimizers for QVCs that is currently lacking.",quant-ph,cat:quant-ph,all:super%20conducting

Corbino disk in gapped-graphene of inner $R_1$ and outer $R_2$ radii in the
presence of magnetic flux $\Phi_i$. We solve Dirac equation for different
regions and obtain the solutions of energy spectrum in terms of Hankel
functions. The asymptotic behaviors for large arguments allow us to determine
the transmission, Fano factor and conductance. We establish the case where the
crystal symmetry is modified locally by replacing a hexagon by pentagon,
square, heptagon or octagon. We show that the wedge disclination $n$ modifies
the amplitude of transmission oscillations. We find that the period of Fano
factor oscillations is of the Aharonov-Bohm type, which strongly depends on $n$
where intense peaks are observed. As another result, $n$ changes the minimum
and period of conductance oscillations of the Aharonov-Bohm type. We show that
$n$ minimizes the effect of resonance and decreases the amplitude of

progress on quantum technologies leads to a promising scalable platform for
realizing quantum computation, conducted by preparing a large-scale graph state
over many qubits and performing single-qubit measurements on the state. With
fault-tolerant MBQC, even if the graph-state preparation suffers from errors
occurring at an unknown physical error rate, we can suppress the effect of the
errors. Verifying graph states is vital to test whether we can conduct MBQC as
desired even with such errors. However, problematically, existing
state-of-the-art protocols for graph-state verification by fidelity estimation
have required measurements on many copies of the entire graph state and hence
have been prohibitively costly in terms of the number of qubits and the
runtime. We here construct an efficient alternative framework for testing graph
states for fault-tolerant MBQC based on the theory of property testing. Our
test protocol accepts with high probability when the physical error rate is
small enough to make fault-tolerant MBQC feasible and rejects when the rate is
above the threshold of fault-tolerant MBQC. The novelty of our protocol is that
we use only a single copy of the $N$-qubit graph state and single-qubit Pauli
measurements only on a constant-sized subset of the qubits; thus, the protocol
has a constant runtime independently of $N$. Furthermore, we can immediately
use the rest of the graph state for fault-tolerant MBQC if the protocol
accepts. These results achieve a significant advantage over prior art for
graph-state verification in the number of qubits and the total runtime.
Consequently, our work offers a new route to a fast and practical framework for
benchmarking large-scale quantum state preparation.",quant-ph,cat:quant-ph,all:super%20conducting

  to an Inhomogeneous Magnetic Field: An Analytic Solution",2022-01-13,Angel Rubio,"An analytic closed form solution is derived for the bound states of electrons
subject to a static, inhomogeneous ($1/r$-decaying) magnetic field, including
the Zeeman interaction. The solution provides access to many-body properties of
a two-dimensional, non-interacting, electron gas in the thermodynamic limit.
Radially distorted Landau levels can be identified as well as magnetic field
induced density and current oscillations close to the magnetic impurity. These
radially localised oscillations depend strongly on the coupling of the spin to
the magnetic field, which give rise to non-trivial spin currents. Moreover, the
Zeeman interaction introduces a lowest flat band for $E_F=0^+$ assuming a spin
$g_s$-factor of two. Surprisingly, in this case the charge and current
densities can be computed analytically in the thermodynamic limit. Numerical
calculations show that the total magnetic response of the electron gas remains
diamagnetic (similar to Landau levels) independent of the Fermi energy.
However, the contribution of certain, infinitely degenerate energy levels may
become paramagnetic. Furthermore, numerical computations of the Hall
conductivity reveal asymptotic properties of the electron gas, which are driven
by the anisotropy of the vector potential instead of the magnetic field, i.e.
become independent of spin. Eventually, the distorted Landau levels give rise
to different Hall conductivity phases, which are characterized by sharp sign
flips at specific Fermi energies. Overall, our work merges ""impurity"" with
Landau-level physics, which provides novel physical insights, not only locally,
but also in the asymptotic limit. This paves the way for a large number of

considered as distinct disciplines. This situation is changing by the progress
in cavity QED materials. Motivated by these advances we aim to bridge these
fields by merging fundamental concepts coming from both sides. In the first
part of the thesis we present how non-relativistic QED can be constructed and
we discuss the light-matter interaction in different gauges and that neglecting
particular quadratic terms can lead to instabilities. In the second part, we
revisit the Sommerfeld model of the free electron gas in cavity QED and provide
the analytic solution for this paradigmatic system coupled to the cavity. We
show that the cavity field modifies the optical conductivity of the electron
gas and suppresses its Drude peak. Further, by constructing an effective field
theory in the continuum of photon modes we show how the photon field leads to a
many-body renormalization of the electron mass, which modifies the fermionic
quasiparticle excitations of the Fermi liquid. In the last part, we show that
translational symmetry for periodic materials in homogeneous magnetic fields
can be restored by embedding the problem into QED. This leads to a
generalization of Bloch's theory for electron-photon systems, that we named as
QED-Bloch theory, which can be applied for the description of periodic
materials in homogeneous magnetic fields and strongly coupled to the quantized
cavity field. As a first application we consider Landau levels coupled to a
cavity and we show that quasiparticle excitations between Landau levels and
photons appear, called Landau polaritons. Further, for periodic materials in
such setups, QED-Bloch theory predicts the emergence of novel fractal
polaritonic energy spectra, which we name as fractal polaritons. The fractal
polaritons are a polaritonic, QED analogue of the Hofstadter butterfly.",quant-ph,cat:quant-ph,all:super%20conducting

inclined passage of a shaped electron wave packet with an electric quadrupole
moment in the non-paraxial regime. Spreading of an asymmetric wave packet
induces quadrupole corrections to the radiation field. Although the
non-paraxial corrections stay small, they are dynamically enhanced during the
interaction of the electron with the grating whose length exceeds the Rayleigh
length of the packet.
  To simplify the possible experimental setup where such effects could be
measured, we study the dependence of these effects on the inclination angle,
i.e. the angle between the mean velocity of the packet and the surface of the
grating. There is a minimal angle such that the multipole expansion always
stays valid at the grating surface. In such a regime, the quadrupole
contribution to the Smith-Purcell radiation can become the leading one, which
represents a novel quantum effect impossible for classical point-like
electrons.
  Thus, the impact of the wave-packet shape (vortex structure or non-spherical

correct for separable errors during the state preparation and measurement
phases of QPT, which are separate from the channel under consideration but may
negatively impact the quality of its reconstruction. We are able to report a

spherical cavity and connect these modes to classical electromagnetic
zero-point radiation and to electromagnetic scale invariance. Then we turn to
the scattering of radiation in classical electron theory within a simple

matter and radiation is disguised so that the mechanical motion appears to
occur without the emission of radiation, even though the particle motion is
actually driven by classical electromagnetic radiation. It is pointed out that,
for nonrelativistic particles, only the harmonic oscillator potential taken in

in a quantum world. For (ordinary) signatures, we focus on the arguably
preferable security notion of blind-unforgeability recently proposed by Alagic

notion: one is in the quantum random oracle model, assuming quantum hardness of
SIS; and the other is in the plain model, assuming quantum hardness of LWE with
super-polynomial modulus. Prior to this work, the only known blind-unforgeable
schemes are Lamport's one-time signature and the Winternitz one-time signature,
and both of them are in the quantum random oracle model.
  For ring signatures, the recent work by Chatterjee et al. (Crypto'21)
proposes a definition trying to capture adversaries with quantum access to the
signer. However, it is unclear if their definition, when restricted to the
classical world, is as strong as the standard security notion for ring
signatures. They also present a construction that only partially achieves
(even) this seeming weak definition, in the sense that the adversary can only
conduct superposition attacks over the messages, but not the rings. We propose
a new definition that does not suffer from the above issue. Our definition is
an analog to the blind-unforgeability in the ring signature setting. Moreover,
assuming the quantum hardness of LWE, we construct a compiler converting any

long-range, three-sublattice, spiral magnetic order which dominates the phase
diagrams for small $J_{\perp}$ and moderate $U$, while a Kondo singlet phase
becomes more stable at large $J_{\perp}$. The transition from the spiral
magnetic order to the Kondo singlet phase is a second-order phase transition.
In the $(J_{\perp}, J_{H})$ plane, we observe that the effect of $J_H$ is to
reduce the Kondo singlet phase, giving more room to the spiral magnetic order
phase. It also introduces some small magnetic oscillations of the spiral
magnetic order parameter. At finite doping and when spiral magnetism is
ignored, we find superconductivity with symmetry order parameter $d+id$, which
breaks time reversal symmetry. The superconducting order parameter has a dome
centered at around $5\%$ hole doping, and its amplitude decreases with
increasing $J_{\perp}$. We show that spiral magnetism can coexist with $d+id$

Coherence time $T_2$ decreases rapidly from $184 \mu s$ at 300 K to $30 \mu s$

Single-quantum and double-quantum relaxation rates show an obvious

sub-Heisenberg scaling of the sensitivity with the system size (e.g., the

decoherence caused by local noises on individual particles or coupling to local
environments, since the local decoherence of any particle would cause the
collapse of the whole cat state. Therefore, it is unclear whether the
sub-Heisenberg scaling of quantum critical metrology is robust against the
local decoherence. Here we study the effects of local decoherence on the

system to compare the measurement outcome with a more accurate value of the
measured quantity. Here, I show that a direct evaluation of measurement
uncertainties is possible when the measurement outcomes are used to compensate
the small amount of decoherence induced in a probe qubit by carefully
controlled interactions with the system. Since the original uncertainty of the
target observable causes fluctuating phase shifts in the probe qubit, any
additional information obtained about the target observable can be used to
compensate a part of the decoherence by applying a conditional phase shift to
the reference qubit. The magnitude of this negative feedback corresponds to an
estimate of the target observable, and the uncompensated decoherence defines
the uncertainty of that estimate. The results of the analysis show that the
uncertainties of the estimates are given by the uncertainties introduced by
Ozawa in Phys. Rev. A 67, 042105 (2003) and the optimal estimates are given by
the weak values associated with the different measurement outcomes. Feedback
compensation of decoherence therefore demonstrates the empirical validity of

Specifically, we consider a qubit bombarded by two-qubit projectiles from a

equation for sequential and collective collisions. By deriving the
Fokker-Planck equation out of the master equation, we identify the quantum
version of the Rayleigh's heat conduction equation. We find that quantum
discord and entanglement shared between the projectiles can contribute to
genuine heat flow only when they are associated with so-called heat-exchange
coherences. Analogous to Onsager's use of Rayleigh's principle of least
dissipation of energy, we use the entropy production rate to identify the
coherence current. Both coherence and heat flows can be written in the form of
quantum Onsager relations, from which we predict coherent Peltier and coherent

spin-orbit coupling and longer-range hopping, is studied at half filling for an
even number of sites. The ground-state phase diagram depends sensitively on the
symmetry of the model. Charge-conjugation (particle-hole) symmetry is conserved
if hopping is only allowed between the two sublattices of even and odd sites.
In this case (of BDI symmetry) we find a variety of topologically non-trivial
phases, characterized by different numbers of edge states (or, equivalently,
different quantized Zak phases). The transitions between these phases are
clearly signalled by the entanglement entropy. Charge-conjugation symmetry is
broken if hopping within the sublattices is admitted (driving the system into
the AI symmetry class). We study specifically next-nearest-neighbor hopping
with amplitudes $t_a$ and $t_b$ for the $A$ and $B$ sublattices, respectively.
For $t_a=t_b$ parity is conserved, and also the quantized Zak phases remain
unchanged in the gapped regions of the phase diagram. However, metallic patches
appear due to the overlap between conduction and valence bands in some regions
of parameter space. The case of alternating next-nearest neighbor hopping,
$t_a=-t_b$, is also remarkable, as it breaks both charge-conjugation $C$ and
parity $P$ but conserves the product $CP$. Both the Zak phase and the
entanglement spectrum still provide relevant information, in particular about
the broken parity. Thus the Zak phase for small values of $t_a$ measures the

density-functional theory (DFT) and $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ theory, we have
calculated hyperfine tensors for electrons and holes in GaAs and crystalline
silicon. Accounting for relativistic effects near the nuclear core, we find
contact hyperfine interactions for electrons in GaAs that are consistent with
Knight-shift measurements performed on GaAs quantum wells and are roughly
consistent with prior estimates extrapolated from measurements on InSb. We find
that a combination of DFT and $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ theory is necessary
to accurately determine the contact hyperfine interaction for electrons at a
conduction-band minimum in silicon that is consistent with bulk Knight-shift
measurements. For hole spins in GaAs, the overall magnitude of the hyperfine
couplings we find from DFT is consistent with previous theory based on
free-atom properties, and with heavy-hole Overhauser shifts measured in GaAs
(and InGaAs) quantum dots. In addition, we theoretically predict that the
heavy-hole hyperfine coupling to the As nuclear spins is stronger and almost
purely Ising-like, while the (weaker) coupling to the Ga nuclear spins has
significant non-Ising corrections. In the case of hole spins in silicon, we
find (surprisingly) that the strength of the hyperfine interaction in the
valence band is comparable to that in the conduction band and that the
hyperfine tensors are highly anisotropic (Ising-like) in the heavy-hole

the same formula, to lowest order, as relativistic neutrinos. Trapping these
particles engenders corrections to their oscillation frequencies because the
interference terms are between discrete energy levels rather than continuous

dependence of the energy levels on the mass of the neutrino: this part of the
correction is nonvanishing even in the extremely nonrelativistic limit,

However, Karasik and Wiseman [Phys. Rev. Lett., 106(2):020406, 2011] showed
that tracking of a qubit ($D=2$) is always possible with a bit ($K=2$), and
gave a heuristic argument implying that a finite $K$ should be sufficient for

Primarily it could lead to the generation of spin Berry phase arising from a
closed loop dynamics of electrons. Our work provides a minimal framework to
generate and detect these effects by employing both spin-unpolarized and
spin-polarized leads. We show that spin-polarized leads could lead to
resonances or anti-resonances in the two-terminal conductance of the

a function of energy of the incident electron) get shifted owing to the

materials can enable collectively enhanced light-matter interactions with
ultrastrong effective coupling strengths. As a paradigmatic example we consider
a Fermi-Hubbard model coupled to a single-mode cavity and find that resonant
electron-cavity interactions result in the formation of a quasi-continuum of
polariton branches. The vacuum Rabi splitting of the two outermost branches is
collectively enhanced and scales with $g_{\text{eff}}\propto\sqrt{2L}$, where
$L$ is the number of electronic sites, and the maximal achievable value for
$g_{\text{eff}}$ is determined by the volume of the unit cell of the crystal.
We find that $g_{\text{eff}}$ for existing quantum materials can by far exceed
the width of the first excited Hubbard band. This effect can be experimentally
observed via measurements of the optical conductivity and does not require
ultra-strong coupling on the single-electron level. Quantum correlations in the

not to produce observable effects over the motion of a charged test particle.
However, when a change in the background vacuum state is implemented, as for
instance when a conducting boundary is introduced, dispersions of the particle
velocity may occur. As a consequence, besides the existence of classical
effects due to the interaction between particle and boundary, there will be a
quantum contribution to the motion of the particle whose magnitude depends on
how fast the transition between the different vacuum states occurs. Here this
issue is revisited and a smooth transition with a controllable switching time
between the vacuum states of the system is implemented. Dispersions of the
particle velocity in both, zero and finite temperature regimes are examined.
More than just generalizing previous results for specific configurations, new
effects are unveiled. Particularly, it is shown that the well known vacuum
dominance reported to occur arbitrarily near the wall is a consequence of
assumed idealizations. The use of a controllable switching enable us to
conclude that thermal effects can be as important as or even stronger than
vacuum effects arbitrarily near the wall. Additionally, the residual effect
predicted to occur in the late time regime was here shown to be linked to the
duration of the transition. In this sense, such effect is understood to be a
sort of particle energy exchanging due to the vacuum state transition.
Furthermore, in certain arrangements a sort of cooling effect over the motion

mean Uhlmann curvatures in a simple setting. More specifically, we consider the
spin honeycomb in the presence of an external magnetic field breaking time
reversal symmetry. The introduction of such an external perturbation opens a
gap in the phase of the system characterised by non-Abelian statistics, and
makes the model to belong to a symmetry protected class, so that the Uhmann

a cross-over effect of the phases at high temperature. We also find an

general analytical expression of the energy transfer amplitude in terms of the

of the Green's tensor exist. We numerically analyse the energy transfer
amplitude when the radius of the waveguide is such that the transition
frequency of both atoms is below the lower cutoff frequency of the waveguide,
so that the resonant photon exchange is strongly suppressed. We consider both
cases of atomic dipoles parallel and orthogonal to the axis of the guide. In
both cases, we find that the energy transfer is modified by the presence of the
waveguide. In the near zone, that is when the atomic separation is smaller than
the atomic transition wavelength, the change, with respect to the free-space
case, is small for axial dipoles, while it is larger for radial dipoles; it
grows when the intermediate region between near and far zone is approached. In
the far zone, we find that the energy transfer amplitude is strongly suppressed

no quantum induced dispersions on the motion of the particle when it is alone

occur with magnitude dependent on how fast the system evolves between the two

idealized sudden switching, for which the transition occurs instantaneously.
Although the sudden process is a simple and mathematically convenient
idealization it brings some divergences to the results, particularly at a time
corresponding to a round trip of a light signal between the particle and the
wall. It is shown that the use of smooth switching functions, besides
regularizing such divergences, enables us to better understand the behavior of
the quantum dispersions induced on the motion of the particle. Furthermore, the

appealing in practice since a single coherent communication system can be used
for multiple purposes. However, previous studies show that the SQCC protocol
can only tolerate very small phase noise. This makes it incompatible with the
coherent communication scheme using a true local oscillator (LO), which
presents a relatively high phase noise due to the fact that the signal and the
LO are generated from two independent lasers. In this paper, we improve the
phase noise tolerance of the SQCC scheme using a true LO by adopting a refined
noise model where phase noises originated from different sources are treated
differently: on one hand, phase noise associated with the coherent receiver may
be regarded as \emph{trusted} noise, since the detector can be calibrated
locally and the photon statistics of the detected signals can be determined
from the measurement results; on the other hand, phase noise due to the
instability of fiber interferometers may be regarded as \emph{untrusted} noise,
since its randomness (from the adversary's point to view) is hard to justify.

the states of the system are mixed via the environment. In the one-channel

methods for verification and validation of quantum behavior. Quantum tomography
(QT) is the standard tool for diagnosing quantum states, process, and readout
devices by providing complete information. However, QT is limited since it is
expensive to not only implement experimentally, but also requires heavy
classical post-processing of data. In this dissertation, we introduce new
methods for QT that are more efficient to implement and robust to noise and
errors, thereby making QT a more practical tool for current quantum information
experiments.
  The crucial detail that makes these new, efficient, and robust methods
possible is prior information about the quantum system. This prior information
is prompted by the goals of most experiments in quantum information, which
require pure states, unitary processes, and rank-1 POVM operators. Therefore,
most experiments are designed to operate near this ideal regime. We show that
when this is the case, QT can be accomplished with significantly fewer
resources, and produce a robust estimate in the presence of noise and errors.
Moreover, the estimate is also robust if the state is not exactly pure, the
process is not exactly unitary, or the POVM is not exactly rank-1. Such
compelling methods are only made possible by the positivity constraint on
quantum states, processes, and POVMs. This requirement is an inherent feature
of quantum mechanics, but has powerful consequences to QT.
  Since QT is necessarily an experimental tool, we discuss a test of these new
methods in an experimental setting. The physical system is an ensemble of
laser-cooled cesium atoms in the laboratory of Prof. Poul Jessen. Experiments
were conducted by Hector Sosa-Martinez et al. to demonstrate different QT

theorem (FDT) is a long-standing open problem widely discussed by the physicist
community since its announcement by Callen and Welton pioneer paper of 1951
[1]. From one hand, it has the drawbacks of: (i) the expectation value of its
energy is infinite, (ii) it produces an ultraviolet catastrophe of the noise
power spectral density and, (iii) it lacks of an experimental validation under
thermal equilibrium conditions. From another hand, by imposing appropriate
boundary conditions and eliminating divergences by regulation techniques,
vacuum fluctuations are the source of an attractive force between opposite
conducting plates, firstly predicted by Casimir in 1948 [2] and later validated
experimentally with increasing accuracy. As a consequence, a quantum
formulation of FDT should account for the presence of the Casimir force and of
its consequences. In this letter we show that at thermal equilibrium the
Casimir force should be balanced by the mechanical reaction of the physical
system. As a consequence, no zero-point spectrum can be detected and the power
spectrum emitted by the physical system is the same of that calculated by

can provide considerable computational advantage. For a crafted problem
designed to have tall and narrow energy barriers separating local minima, the
D-Wave 2X quantum annealer achieves significant runtime advantages relative to
Simulated Annealing (SA). For instances with 945 variables, this results in a
time-to-99%-success-probability that is $\sim 10^8$ times faster than SA
running on a single processor core. We also compared physical QA with Quantum
Monte Carlo (QMC), an algorithm that emulates quantum tunneling on classical
processors. We observe a substantial constant overhead against physical QA:
D-Wave 2X again runs up to $\sim 10^8$ times faster than an optimized
implementation of QMC on a single core. We note that there exist heuristic
classical algorithms that can solve most instances of Chimera structured
problems in a timescale comparable to the D-Wave 2X. However, we believe that
such solvers will become ineffective for the next generation of annealers
currently being designed. To investigate whether finite range tunneling will
also confer an advantage for problems of practical interest, we conduct
numerical studies on binary optimization problems that cannot yet be

proportional to the admittance for a large range of frequencies and voltages.
However, when the quantum conductor is near a resonance, such a relation
generally holds only at low frequency and for equal tunnel coupling or low

Casimir-Polder forces between an atom or molecule and two macroscopic bodies
can be achieved. This is an extension of previous studies of the interaction
between a polarizable atom and a wedge, in which repulsion occurs if the atom
is sufficiently anisotropic and close enough to the symmetry plane of the
wedge. A similar repulsion occurs if such an atom passes a thin cylinder or a
wire. An obvious extension is to compute the interaction between such an atom
and two facing wedges, which includes as a special case the interaction of an
atom with a conducting screen possessing a slit, or between two parallel wires.
To this end we further extend the electromagnetic multiple-scattering formalism
for three-body interactions. To test this machinery we reinvestigate the
interaction of a polarizable atom between two parallel conducting plates. In
that case, three-body effects are shown to be small, and are dominated by
three- and four-scattering terms. The atom-wedge calculation is illustrated by
an analogous scalar situation, described in the Appendix. The wedge-wedge-atom
geometry is difficult to analyze because this is a scale-free problem. But it
is not so hard to investigate the three-body corrections to the interaction
between an anisotropic atom or nanoparticle and a pair of parallel conducting
cylinders, and show that the three-body effects are very small and do not
affect the Casimir-Polder repulsion at large distances between the cylinders.

field theory in the presence of boundaries, manifesting itself as a torque
anomaly. In particular, Fulling et al. used the finite energy-momentum-stress
tensor in the presence of a perfectly conducting wedge, calculated many years
ago by Deutsch and Candelas, to compute the torque on one of the wedge
boundaries, where the latter was cutoff by integrating the torque density down
to minimum lower radius greater than zero. They observed that that torque is
not equal to the negative derivative of the energy obtained by integrating the
energy density down to the same minimum radius. This motivated a calculation of
the torque and energy in an annular sector obtained by the intersection of the
wedge with two coaxial cylinders. In a previous paper we showed that for the
analogous scalar case, which also exhibited a torque anomaly in the absence of
the cylindrical boundaries, the point-split regulated torque and energy indeed
exhibit an anomaly, unless the point-splitting is along the axis direction. In
any case, because of curvature divergences, no unambiguous finite part can be
extracted. However, that ambiguity is linear in the wedge angle; if the
condition is imposed that the linear term be removed, the resulting torque and
energy is finite, and exhibits no anomaly. In this paper, we demonstrate the
same phenomenon takes place for the electromagnetic field, so there is no
torque anomaly present here either. This is a nontrivial generalization, since
the anomaly found by Fulling et al. is linear for the Dirichlet scalar case,

temperatures, the most striking of which is the ultrasonic attenuation
coefficient Q. The established theory of tunneling two state systems (TTLS) in
its original form (i.e. without extra fitting functions and parameters), is
unable to explain this universality. While the TTLS model can be modified,
particularly by including long range phonon induced interactions to explain the
universal value of Q, (a) it is not clear that the essential features of the
original model that has been successful in explaining the experimental data is
preserved, and (b) even if it is, it is not clear that the postulates of the
original model remain necessary. The purpose of this study is to derive the
universal acoustic absorption and related quantities observed in disordered
solids by starting from a many-body quantum theory of unspecified amorphous
blocks that mutually interact through the strain field. Based on very generic
assumptions and having no adjustable fitting parameters, the frequency and
initial state averaged macroscopic attenuation of a group of interacting
disordered blocks is calculated in the low temperature regime by a novel ""trace
method"", which then is iterated up-to experimental length scales through a real
space renormalization group approach. Then using a heuristic second-order
perturbation argument, the frequency dependence of Q is found, and combined
with the previous result to yield the observed universal values in the MHz-Ghz
range of frequencies. It is concluded that strong microscopic postulates are
not necessary in order to explain the thermal conductivity, velocity shift and
sound attenuation of disordered media in the low temperature regime.",cond-mat.dis-nn,cat:quant-ph,all:super%20conducting

fundamental question has also direct implications for the quantum engineering
of nanoelectronic devices. Indeed, when a quantum coherent conductor is
inserted into a circuit, its transport properties are modified. In particular,
its conductance is reduced because of the circuit back-action. This phenomenon,
called environmental Coulomb blockade, results from the granularity of charge
transfers across the coherent conductor. Although extensively studied for a
tunnel junction in a linear circuit, it is only fully understood for arbitrary
short coherent conductors in the limit of small circuit impedances and small
conductance reduction. Here, we investigate experimentally the strong
back-action regime, with a conductance reduction of up to 90%. This is achieved
by embedding a single quantum channel of tunable transmission in an adjustable
on-chip circuit of impedance comparable to the resistance quantum $R_K=h/e^2$

Exploiting the idea that the recently introduced semiquantum nonlocal games as
the gauge of the amount of entanglement in a state, we define an effective
entanglement functional giving us effective entanglement when the measurement
operators one has at their disposal are restricted by either fundamental
considerations, such as superselection rules, or practical inability to conduct
precise measurements. We show that effective entanglement is always reduced by
restricting measurements. We define effective entanglement as the least amount
of entanglement necessary to play all semiquantum nonlocal games at least as
well with unrestricted measurements as with the more entangled original state
and restricted measurements. We show that simple linear relationship between
effective and conventional G-concurrence, generalization of concurrence, can be
obtained when completely positive maps are used to describe measurement
restrictions. We consider how typical measurement errors like photon loss and
phase damping degrade effective entanglement in quantum optical experiments, as
well as the impact of mass superselection rules on entanglement of massive
indistinguishable particles. The flexibility of the effective entanglement

magnetodielectric media, we argue that the correct boundary conditions are the
continuities of $\mathbf{H}_{\parallel}, \phi, \mathbf{A}$ and $\pa_xA_x$,

transverse modes that satisfy all the boundary conditions, it is impossible to
find type II transverse modes or longitudinal modes that satisfy all the

local energy densities, obtained from the vacuum expectation value of the
energy-momentum tensor, $\langle T_{00}\rangle$, typically diverge near
boundaries. The energy of interaction between distinct rigid bodies of whatever
type is finite, corresponding to observable forces and torques between the
bodies, which can be unambiguously calculated. The self-energy of a body is
less well-defined, and suffers divergences which may or may not be removable.
Some examples where a unique total self-stress may be evaluated include the
perfectly conducting spherical shell first considered by Boyer, a perfectly
conducting cylindrical shell, and dilute dielectric balls and cylinders. In
these cases the finite part is unique, yet there are divergent contributions
which may be subsumed in some sort of renormalization of physical parameters.
The divergences that occur in the local energy-momentum tensor near surfaces
are distinct from the divergences in the total energy, which are often
associated with energy located exactly on the surfaces. However, the local
energy-momentum tensor couples to gravity, so what is the significance of
infinite quantities here? For the classic situation of parallel plates there

the coupling strength $v$ to the two attached leads. The leads are identical
with only one propagating mode $\xi^E_C$ in each of them. Besides the
conductance $G$, we calculate the phase rigidity $\rho$ of the scattering wave
function $\Psi^E_C$ in the interior of the system. Most interesting results are
obtained in the regime of strongly overlapping resonance states where the
crossover from staying to traveling modes takes place. The crossover is
characterized by collective effects. Here, the conductance is plateau-like
enhanced in some energy regions of finite length while corridors with zero
transmission (total reflection) appear in other energy regions. This
transmission picture depends only weakly on the spectrum of the closed system.
It is caused by the alignment of some resonance states of the system with the
propagating modes $\xi^E_C$ in the leads. The alignment of resonance states
takes place stepwise by resonance trapping, i.e. it is accompanied by the
decoupling of other resonance states from the continuum of propagating modes.
This process is quantitatively described by the phase rigidity $\rho$ of the
scattering wave function. Averaged over energy in the considered energy window,
$<G>$ is correlated with $1-<\rho>$. In the regime of strong coupling, only two
short-lived resonance states survive each aligned with one of the channel wave

ample information not easily revealed by conductance measurements. Phase
measurements in relatively large quantum dots (QDs) recently demonstrated a
universal like phase evolution independent of dot size, shape, and occupancy.
Explicitly, in Coulomb blockaded QDs the transmission phase increased
monotonically by pi throughout each conductance peak, thereafter, in the
conductance valleys the phase returned sharply to its base value. Expected
mesoscopic features in the phase, related to spin degeneracy or to exchange
effects, were never observed. Presently, there is no satisfactory full
explanation for the observed phase universality. Unfortunately, the phase in a
few-electron QDs, where it can be better understood was never measured. Here we
report on such measurements on a small QD that occupy only 1-20 electrons. Such
dot was embedded in one arm of a two path electron interferometer, with an
electron counter near the dot. Unlike the repetitive behavior found in larger
dots we found now mesoscopic features for dot occupation of less than some 10
electrons. An unexpected feature in this regime is a clear observation of the
occupation of two different orbital states by the first two electrons -
contrary to the recent publications. As the occupation increased the phase
evolved and turned universal like for some 14 electrons and higher. The present
measurements allowed us to determine level occupancy and parity. More
importantly, they suggest that QDs go through a phase transition, from
mesoscopic to universal like behavior, as the occupancy increases. These
measurements help in singling out potential few theoretical models among the

renormalized hybridization pseudogap scale $T^{*}$, which correlates with the
single-ion Kondo scale, and a lattice Kondo scale $T_{0} < T^{*}$, which acts
as the Fermi-liquid coherence scale. The lattice Kondo resonance is split into
a main branch, which is pinned at the Fermi level, and whose width is set by
$T_{0}$, and an upper branch at $\omega\approx T^{*}$. The weight of the upper

Casimir force is a direct manifestation of the boundary dependence of quantum

  We discuss in depth the general structure of the infinities in the field
theory which are removed by a combination of zeta-functional regularization and
