http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.13182v1,Learning Super-Features for Image Retrieval,2022-01-31,Yannis Kalantidis,"Methods that combine local and global features have recently shown excellent
performance on multiple challenging deep image retrieval benchmarks, but their
use of local features raises at least two issues. First, these local features
simply boil down to the localized map activations of a neural network, and
hence can be extremely redundant. Second, they are typically trained with a
global loss that only acts on top of an aggregation of local features; by
contrast, testing is based on local feature matching, which creates a
discrepancy between training and testing. In this paper, we propose a novel
architecture for deep image retrieval, based solely on mid-level features that
we call Super-features. These Super-features are constructed by an iterative
attention module and constitute an ordered set in which each element focuses on
a localized and discriminant image pattern. For training, they require only
image labels. A contrastive loss operates directly at the level of
Super-features and focuses on those that match across images. A second
complementary loss encourages diversity. Experiments on common landmark
retrieval benchmarks validate that Super-features substantially outperform
state-of-the-art methods when using the same number of features, and only
require a significantly smaller memory footprint to match their performance.

multiplanetary systems, suggesting that they are appropriate to study
composition and formation within the same environment. We perform a homogeneous
interior structure analysis of five multiplanetary systems to explore the
compositional trends and its relation with planet formation. For K2-138, we
present revised masses and stellar host chemical abundances to improve the
constraints on the planetary interior. We conduct a line-by-line differential
spectroscopic analysis on the stellar spectra to obtain its chemical abundances

more low-mass planets that have both mass and radius data available. We carry
out a homogeneous interior structure analysis on the systems K2-138, TOI-178,
Kepler-11, Kepler-102 and Kepler-80 and estimate the volatile mass fraction of
their planets assuming a volatile layer constituted of water in steam and
supercritical phases. Our interior-atmosphere model takes into account the
effects of irradiation on the surface conditions. K2-138 inner planets present
an increasing volatile mass fraction with distance from its host star, while
the outer planets present an approximately constant water content. This is
similar to the trend observed in TRAPPIST-1 in a previous analysis with the
same interior-atmosphere model. The Kepler-102 system could potentially present
this trend. In all multiplanetary systems, the low volatile mass fraction of
the inner planets could be due to atmospheric escape while the higher volatile
mass fraction of the outer planets can be the result of accretion of ice-rich
material in the vicinity of the ice line with later inward migration.

  black holes",2022-01-27,Rony Keppens,"The theory of instability of accretion disks about black holes, neutron stars
or proto-planets, is revisited by means of the recent method of the Spectral
Web. The cylindrical accretion disk differential equation is shown to be
governed by the forward and backward Doppler-shifted continuous Alfv\'en
spectra $\Omega_{\rm A}^\pm \equiv m \Omega \pm \omega_{\rm A}$, where
$\omega_{\rm A}$ is the static Alfv\'en frequency. It is crucial to take
non-axisymmetry ($m \ne 0$) and super-Alfv\'enic rotation of the Doppler frames
($|m\Omega| \gg |\omega_{\rm A}|$) into account. The continua $\Omega_{\rm
A}^+$ and $\Omega_{\rm A}^-$ then overlap, ejecting a plethora of
Super-Alfv\'enic Rotational Instabilities (SARIs). In-depth analysis for small
inhomogeneity shows that the two Alfv\'en singularities reduce the extent of
the modes to sizes much smaller than the width of the accretion disk.
Generalization for large inhomogeneity leads to the completely unprecedented
result that, for mode numbers $|k| \gg |m|$, any complex $\omega$ in a wide
neighborhood of the real axis is an approximate `eigenvalue'. The difference
with genuine eigenmodes is that the amount of complementary energy to excite
the modes is tiny, $|W_{\rm com}| \le c$, with $c$ the machine accuracy of the
computation. This yields a multitude of two-dimensional continua of
quasi-discrete modes: quasi-continuum SARIs. We conjecture that the onset of 3D
turbulence in magnetized accretion disks is governed, not by the excitation of
discrete axisymmetric Magneto-Rotational Instabilities, but by the excitation
of modes from these two-dimensional continua of quasi-discrete non-axisymmetric
Super-Alfv\'enic Rotational Instabilities.",astro-ph.HE,cat:quant-ph,all:super%20conducting

of $\sim 10^9\rm\, M_\odot$ supermassive black holes (BHs) within the first
billion year of the Universe. This critical regime is associated with
radiatively inefficient accretion and accompanied by powerful outflows in the
form of winds and jets. By means of hydrodynamical simulations of BH evolution
in an isolated galaxy and its host halo with 12 pc resolution, we investigate
how super-Eddington feedback affects the mass growth of the BH. It is shown
that super-Eddington feedback efficiently prevents BH growth within a few Myr.
The super-Eddington accretion events remain relatively mild with typical rates
of about 2-3 times the Eddington limit, because of the efficient regulation by
jets in that regime. We find that these jets are powerful enough to eject gas
from the centre of the host galaxy all the way up to galactic scales at a few
kpc, but do not significantly impact gas inflows at those large scales. By
varying the jet feedback efficiency, we find that weaker super-Eddington jets
allow for more significant BH growth through more frequent episodes of
super-Eddington accretion. We conclude that effective super-Eddington growth is
possible, as we find that simulations with weak jet feedback efficiencies
provide a slightly larger BH mass evolution over long periods of time ($\sim
80\,\rm Myr$) than that for a BH accreting at the Eddington limit.",astro-ph.GA,cat:quant-ph,all:super%20conducting

original perceptual loss to solve the problem of single image super-resolution

these approaches are all convolution-based, and are naturally weak in global
relation modeling of sub-aperture images necessarily to characterize the
inherent structure of light fields. In this paper, we put forth a novel
formulation built upon Transformers, by treating LFSR as a sequence-to-sequence

long-range geometric dependencies within each sequence via a spatial-angular

  Microphones",2021-12-24,Shao-fu Shih,"Voice communication using the air conduction microphone in noisy environments
suffers from the degradation of speech audibility. Bone conduction microphones
(BCM) are robust against ambient noises but suffer from limited effective
bandwidth due to their sensing mechanism. Although existing audio super
resolution algorithms can recover the high frequency loss to achieve
high-fidelity audio, they require considerably more computational resources
than available in low-power hearable devices. This paper proposes the
first-ever real-time on-chip speech audio super resolution system for BCM. To
accomplish this, we built and compared a series of lightweight audio super
resolution deep learning models. Among all these models, ATS-UNet is the most
cost-efficient because the proposed novel Audio Temporal Shift Module (ATSM)
reduces the network's dimensionality while maintaining sufficient temporal
features from speech audios. Then we quantized and deployed the ATS-UNet to
low-end ARM micro-controller units for real-time embedded prototypes.
Evaluation results show that our system achieved real-time inference speed on
Cortex-M7 and higher quality than the baseline audio super resolution method.
Finally, we conducted a user study with ten experts and ten amateur listeners
to evaluate our method's effectiveness to human ears. Both groups perceived a
significantly higher speech quality with our method when compared to the
solutions with the original BCM or air conduction microphone with cutting-edge
noise reduction algorithms.",cs.SD,cat:quant-ph,all:super%20conducting

dot, containing roughly 900 electrons, in a wide magnetic field range from 0 T
to 12 T. We find modulations of the conductance resonances in the quantum Hall
regime for higher integer filling factors $6> \nu_\mathrm{dot} > 2$, in
addition to modulations at $2> \nu_\mathrm{dot} > 1$ and at fractional filling
factors $\nu_\mathrm{dot} \gtrsim 2/3$, $1/3$. Depending on the internal
filling factor, edge reconstruction inside the quantum dot leads to the
formation of multiple concentric compressible regions, which contain discrete
charge and are separated by incompressible rings. Quasiparticle tunneling
between different compressible regions results in
magnetic-field-(pseudo)-periodic modulations of the Coulomb resonances with
different periodicities, additional super-periodicity or non-periodic features.
The evolution of the period in magnetic field indicates cyclic depopulation of
the inner compressible regions close to integer filing factors. We study the
temperature dependence of the conductance resonances for different magnetic
fields. While at low fields, the resonance amplitude decays inversely with
temperature, corresponding to single-level transport, the temperature
dependence of the amplitude evolves continuously into a linearly increasing
behavior for dot filling factor $2> \nu_\mathrm{dot} > 1$. This coincides with
a reduction of the charging energy by approximately a factor of 2 in the same
regime. At zero magnetic field, the temperature dependence differs for
individual resonances, and is found to depend on the closeness to quantum dot

Majorana bound states (MBSs) by combining topological superconductivity with
quantum optics in a superconducting pn-junction containing a quantum dot (QD).
We consider a topological superconductor (TSC) hosting two Majorana bound
states at its boundary (n-side). Within an effective low-energy model, the MBSs
are coherently tunnel-coupled to a spin-split electron level on the QD which is
placed close to one of the MBSs. Holes on the QD are tunnel-coupled to a normal
conducting reservoir (p-side). Via electron-hole recombination, photons in the
optical range are emitted, which have direct information on the MBS-properties
through the recombined electrons. Using a master equation approach, we
calculate the polarization-resolved photon emission intensities (PEIs). In the
weak coupling regime between MBSs and QD, we find an analytical expression for
the PEI which allows to clearly distinguish the cases of well separated MBSs at
zero energy from overlapping MBSs. For separated MBSs, the Majorana
spinor-polarization is given by the relative widths of the two PEI peaks
associated with the two spin states on the QD. For overlapping MBSs, a coupling
to the distant (nonlocal) MBS causes a shift of the emission peaks.
Additionally, we show that quasiparticle poisoning (QP) influences the PEI
drastically and changes its shot noise from super-Poissonian to sub-Poissonian.
In the strong coupling regime, more resonances emerge in the PEI due to
spin-mixing effects. Finally, we comment on how our proposal could be
implemented using a Majorana nanowire.",cond-mat.mes-hall,cat:quant-ph,all:super%20conducting

disruption event candidate during a prolonged ($>11$ yrs) outburst (Lin et al.
2017). It exhibited unique quasi-soft X-ray spectra of characteristic
temperature $kT\sim0.3$ keV for several years at the peak, but in a recent
Chandra observation (10 yrs into the outburst) a super-soft X-ray spectrum of
$kT\sim0.15$ keV was detected. Such dramatic spectral softening could signal
the transition from the super-Eddington to thermal state or the temporary
presence of a warm absorber. Here we report on our study of four new XMM-Newton
follow-up observations of the source. We found that they all showed super-soft
spectra, suggesting that the source had remained super-soft for $>5$ yrs. Then
its spectral change is best explained as due to the super-Eddington to thermal
spectral state transition. The fits to the thermal state spectra suggested a
smaller absorption toward the source than that obtained in Lin et al. (2017).
This led us to update the modeling of the event as due to the disruption of a
0.75 msun star by a massive black hole of a few$\times10^5$ msun. We also
obtained two HST images in the F606W and F814W filters and found that the dwarf

  modes? -- Insights from von Neumann entropy",2021-12-04,Bhaskaran Muralidharan,"The topological origin of the zero bias conductance signatures obtained via
conductance spectroscopy in topological superconductor hybrid systems is a much
contended issue. Recently, non-local conductance signatures that exploit the
non-locality of the zero modes in three terminal hybrid setups have been
proposed as means to ascertain the definitive presence of Majorana modes. The
topological entanglement entropy, which is based on the von Neumann entropy, is
yet another way to gauge the non-locality in connection with the bulk-boundary
correspondence of a topological phase. We show that while both the entanglement
entropy and the non-local conductance exhibit a clear topological phase
transition signature for long enough pristine nanowires, non-local conductance
fails to signal a topological phase transition for shorter disordered wires.
While recent experiments have indeed shown premature gap-closure signatures in
the non-local conductance spectra, we believe that the entanglement entropy can
indeed signal a genuine transition, regardless of the constituent
non-idealities in an experimental situation. Our results thereby point toward
furthering the development of experimental techniques beyond conductance

including an entangled partner of the two-point sources. Unexpectedly, it is
found that the two negative effects can counter affect each other, thus
permitting credible super-resolution, when the measurement is analyzed in the

two-dimensional (2D) semimetals hosting tilted and anisotropic Dirac cones in
the bandstructure is analysed theoretically. Super-critically tilted (type-II)
Dirac cones are characterised by an absorption that is highly dependent on the
incident photon polarisation and frequency, and is tunable by changing the
Fermi level with a back-gate voltage. Type-II Dirac cones exhibit open Fermi
surfaces and large regions of the Brillouin zone where the valence and
conduction bands sit either above or below the Fermi level. As a consequence,
unlike their sub-critically tilted (type-I) counterparts, type-II Dirac cones
have many states that are Pauli blocked even when the Fermi level is tuned to
the level crossing point. We analyse the interplay of the tilt parameter with
the Fermi velocity anisotropy, demonstrating that the optical response of a
Dirac cone cannot be described by its tilt alone. As a special case of our
general theory we discuss the proposed 2D type-I semimetal 8-$Pmmn$ Borophene.
Guided by our in-depth analytics we develop an optical recipe to fully

principle to effectively recover image content from noisy images. Current
state-of-the-art methods use deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
effectively learn the mapping from noisy to clean images. Deep denoising CNNs
manifest a high learning capacity and integrate non-local information owing to
the large receptive field yielded by numerous cascade of hidden layers.
However, deep networks are also computationally complex and require large data

Self-organized Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs) empowered by a novel
neuron model that can achieve a similar or better denoising performance with a
compact and shallow model. Recently, the concept of super-neurons has been
introduced which augment the non-linear transformations of generative neurons
by utilizing non-localized kernel locations for an enhanced receptive field
size. This is the key accomplishment which renders the need for a deep network

denoising, in this work we investigate the use of super neurons for both

the heterogeneity of non-localized operations and computational complexity. Our
results demonstrate that with the same width and depth, Self-ONNs with super

Thresholds to address these challenges. Our model subsumes combinatorial
bandits by considering super arms to be subsets of groups of base arms. We seek
to maximize super arm rewards while satisfying thresholds of all base arm
groups that constitute a super arm. To this end, we define a new notion of
regret that merges super arm reward maximization with group reward
satisfaction. To facilitate learning, we assume that the mean outcomes of base

a spectral bias towards lower frequencies, which has been leveraged for various
image restoration tasks in the Deep Image Prior (DIP) framework. The benefit of
the inductive bias the network imposes in the DIP framework depends on the

determine the best-performing model. However, common neural architecture search
(NAS) techniques are resource and time-intensive. Moreover, best-performing
models are determined for a whole dataset of images instead of for each image
independently, which would be prohibitively expensive. In this work, we first
show that optimal neural architectures in the DIP framework are
image-dependent. Leveraging this insight, we then propose an image-specific NAS
strategy for the DIP framework that requires substantially less training than
typical NAS approaches, effectively enabling image-specific NAS. For a given
image, noise is fed to a large set of untrained CNNs, and their outputs' power
spectral densities (PSD) are compared to that of the corrupted image using
various metrics. Based on this, a small cohort of image-specific architectures
is chosen and trained to reconstruct the corrupted image. Among this cohort,
the model whose reconstruction is closest to the average of the reconstructed

effectiveness by (1) demonstrating its performance on a NAS Dataset for DIP

normalize the distributions of intermediate layers in deep learning, enabling
faster training and better generalization accuracy. However, in fidelity image
Super-Resolution (SR), it is believed that normalization layers get rid of
range flexibility by normalizing the features and they are simply removed from
modern SR networks. In this paper, we study this phenomenon quantitatively and
qualitatively. We found that the standard deviation of the residual feature
shrinks a lot after normalization layers, which causes the performance
degradation in SR networks. Standard deviation reflects the amount of variation
of pixel values. When the variation becomes smaller, the edges will become less
discriminative for the network to resolve. To address this problem, we propose
an Adaptive Deviation Modulator (AdaDM), in which a modulation factor is
adaptively predicted to amplify the pixel deviation. For better generalization
performance, we apply BN in state-of-the-art SR networks with the proposed

utilizing an additional pre-trained network, we design a simple but effective
embedding network inherited from the discriminator network and can be
iteratively optimized with the primary SR network making it task-generalizable.

hence, forming a pyramidal Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) like design. In
this work, we investigate local and global information modelling in

windows and special tokens, called Super tokens, for self-attention.
Specifically, a single Super token is assigned to each image window which
captures the rich local details for that window. These tokens are then employed
for cross-window communication and global representation learning. Hence, most
of the learning is independent of the image patches $(N)$ in the higher layers,
and the class embedding is learned solely based on the Super tokens $(N/M^2)$
where $M^2$ is the window size. In standard image classification on

two-dimensional numerical hydrodynamic simulations of the gap formation process

  Efficient Hyperspectral Image Super-resolution",2021-11-16,Darren Dancey,"Realistic hyperspectral image (HSI) super-resolution (SR) techniques aim to
generate a high-resolution (HR) HSI with higher spectral and spatial fidelity
from its low-resolution (LR) counterpart. The generative adversarial network
(GAN) has proven to be an effective deep learning framework for image
super-resolution. However, the optimisation process of existing GAN-based
models frequently suffers from the problem of mode collapse, leading to the
limited capacity of spectral-spatial invariant reconstruction. This may cause
the spectral-spatial distortion on the generated HSI, especially with a large
upscaling factor. To alleviate the problem of mode collapse, this work has
proposed a novel GAN model coupled with a latent encoder (LE-GAN), which can
map the generated spectral-spatial features from the image space to the latent
space and produce a coupling component to regularise the generated samples.
Essentially, we treat an HSI as a high-dimensional manifold embedded in a
latent space. Thus, the optimisation of GAN models is converted to the problem
of learning the distributions of high-resolution HSI samples in the latent
space, making the distributions of the generated super-resolution HSIs closer
to those of their original high-resolution counterparts. We have conducted
experimental evaluations on the model performance of super-resolution and its
capability in alleviating mode collapse. The proposed approach has been tested
and validated based on two real HSI datasets with different sensors (i.e.
AVIRIS and UHD-185) for various upscaling factors and added noise levels, and

transportation planning and engineering must innovate to expand the street
network strategically in order to ensure efficiency but also to deter sprawl.
Here, we conducted a study of over 200 cities around the world to understand
the impact that the patterns of deceleration points in streets due to traffic
signs has in trajectories done from motorized vehicles. We demonstrate that
there is a ubiquitous nonlinear relationship between time and distance in the
optimal trajectories within each city. More precisely, given a specific period
of time $\tau$, without any traffic, one can move on average up to the distance
$\left \langle D \right \rangle \sim\tau^\beta$. We found a super-linear
relationship for almost all cities in which $\beta>1.0$. This points to an
efficiency of scale when traveling large distances, meaning the average speed
will be higher for longer trips when compared to shorter trips. We demonstrate
that this efficiency is a consequence of the spatial distribution of large
segments of streets without deceleration points, favoring access to routes in
which a vehicle can cross large distances without stops. These findings show
that cities must consider how their street morphology can affect travel speed.",physics.soc-ph,cat:quant-ph,all:super%20conducting

It gives a clear representation of the object in context. But if this image is
not clear it might not be of much use. Thus, the topic of Image Super
Resolution arose and many researchers have been working towards applying
Computer Vision and Deep Learning Techniques to increase the quality of images.
One of the applications of Super Resolution is to increase the quality of
Portrait Images. Portrait Images are images which mainly focus on capturing the
essence of the main object in the frame, where the object in context is
highlighted whereas the background is occluded. When performing Super
Resolution the model tries to increase the overall resolution of the image. But
in portrait images the foreground resolution is more important than that of the
background. In this paper, the performance of a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) architecture known as U-Net for Super Resolution combined with Mask
Region Based CNN (MR-CNN) for foreground super resolution is analysed. This
analysis is carried out based on Localized Super Resolution i.e. We pass the LR

performance under non-blind setting where blur kernel is known. However, blur
kernels of Low-Resolution (LR) images in different practical applications are
usually unknown. It may lead to significant performance drop when degradation
process of training images deviates from that of real images. In this paper, we
propose a novel blind SR framework to super-resolve LR images degraded by
arbitrary blur kernel with accurate kernel estimation in frequency domain. To
our best knowledge, this is the first deep learning method which conducts blur
kernel estimation in frequency domain. Specifically, we first demonstrate that
feature representation in frequency domain is more conducive for blur kernel
reconstruction than in spatial domain. Next, we present a Spectrum-to-Kernel
(S$2$K) network to estimate general blur kernels in diverse forms. We use a
Conditional GAN (CGAN) combined with SR-oriented optimization target to learn
the end-to-end translation from degraded images' spectra to unknown kernels.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world images demonstrate that
our proposed method sufficiently reduces blur kernel estimation error, thus
enables the off-the-shelf non-blind SR methods to work under blind setting
effectively, and achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art blind SR

  due to Heat Current Anticorrelations",2021-10-22,Laura de Sousa Oliveira,"The ability to minimize the thermal conductivity of dielectric materials with
a minimal structural intervention that could affect electrical properties is an
important tool for engineering good thermoelectric efficiency in low-cost
semiconductor materials such as Si. Special arrangements for pores in
nanoporous Si have been recently identified in our previous work to produce a
particularly large reduction in thermal conductivity accompanied by strongly
anticorrelated heat current fluctuations. This manuscript presents the results
of molecular dynamics simulations and a Monte Carlo ray-tracing model that
further teases apart this phenomenon to reveal how the special pore layouts
produce correlated scattering of the heat-carrying phonons. This means that
heat carried by a phonon before scattering is undone by the scattered phonon,
resulting in an effective mean-free-path which is significantly shorter than
the distance that the phonons travel between the pores. This effect is
particularly noticeable for the long wavelength, long mean-free-path phonons
whose transport is impeded drastically more than what expected purely from the
usual considerations of scattering defined by the distance between defects.
This super suppression of the mean-free-path below the characteristic scale of
the nanostructuring offers a route for minimizing thermal conductivity with
minimal structural impact, while the stronger impact on long wavelengths offer
possibilities for the design of `band-pass' phonon filtering. Moreover, the
ray-tracing model developed in this paper shows that different forms of
correlated scattering imprint a unique signature in the heat current

fuse a low-spatial-resolution HSI and a high-spatial-resolution multispectral

learning-based approaches are mostly supervised that rely on a large number of
labeled training samples, which is unrealistic. The commonly used model-based
approaches are unsupervised and flexible but rely on hand-craft priors.
Inspired by the specific properties of model, we make the first attempt to
design a model inspired deep network for HSI super-resolution in an
unsupervised manner. This approach consists of an implicit autoencoder network
built on the target HR-HSI that treats each pixel as an individual sample. The
nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) of the target HR-HSI is integrated into
the autoencoder network, where the two NMF parts, spectral and spatial
matrices, are treated as decoder parameters and hidden outputs respectively. In
the encoding stage, we present a pixel-wise fusion model to estimate hidden
outputs directly, and then reformulate and unfold the model's algorithm to form
the encoder network. With the specific architecture, the proposed network is
similar to a manifold prior-based model, and can be trained patch by patch

size interior to the snow line delays the growth of super-Earths, allowing
giant planet cores in the outer disk to form first. When those giant planets
reach pebble isolation mass they cut off the flow of pebbles to the inner disk
and prevent the formation of close-in super-Earths. We apply this model to
stars with masses between 0.1 and 2 solar mass and for a range of initial disk
masses. We find that the masses of hot super-Earths and of cold giant planets
are anti-correlated. The fraction of our simulations that form hot super-Earths
is higher around lower-mass stars and matches the exoplanet occurrence rates
from Kepler. The fraction of simulations forming cold giant planets is
consistent with the stellar mass dependence from radial velocity surveys. A key

super-Earths. They are inside a range of critical masses overlapping the core
masses (2-20 $M_{\bigoplus}$), which would trigger the runaway accretion and
develop the gas giants. Thus, super-Earths/sub-Neptunes can be formed by
restraining runaway growth of gaseous envelopes. We assess the effect of
planetary rotation in delaying the mass growth. The centrifugal force, induced
by spin, will offset a part of the gravitational force and deform the planet.
Tracking the change in structure, we find that the temperature at the
radiative-convective boundary (RCB) is approximate to the boundary temperature.
Since rotation reduces the radiation energy densities in the convective and
radiative layers, RCB will penetrate deeper. The cooling luminosity would
decrease. Under this condition, the evolutionary timescale can exceed the disk
lifetime (10 Myr), and a super-Earth/sub-Neptune could be formed after
undergoing additional mass loss processes. In the dusty atmosphere, even a
lower angular velocity can also promote a super-Earth/sub-Neptune forming.

aspects. On the one hand, we restore high-resolution gradient maps by a
gradient branch to provide additional structure priors for the SR process. On
the other hand, we propose a gradient loss to impose a second-order restriction

may only be able to capture limited aspects of structural information, we
further extend SPSR-G by introducing a learnable neural structure extractor

the inner regions of accretion disks around black holes using the echoes of the
coronal emission reflected by the disk. While the theory of X-ray reverberation
has been developed almost exclusively for standard thin disks, recently
reverberation lags have been observed from likely super-Eddington accretion
sources such as the jetted tidal disruption event Swift J1644+57. In this
paper, we extend X-ray reverberation studies into the super-Eddington accretion
regime, focusing on investigating the lags in the Fe K{\alpha} line region. We
find that the coronal photons are mostly reflected by the fast and optically
thick winds launched from super-Eddington accretion flow, and this funnel-like
reflection geometry produces lag-frequency and lag-energy spectra with unique
characteristics. The lag-frequency spectra exhibits a step-function like
decline near the first zero-crossing point. As a result, the shape of the
lag-energy spectra remains almost independent of the choice of frequency bands
and linearly scales with the black hole mass for a large range of parameter
spaces. Not only can these morphological differences be used to distinguish
super-Eddington accretion systems from sub-Eddington systems, they are also key
for constraining the reflection geometry and extracting parameters from the
observed lags. When explaining the X-ray reverberation lags of Swift J1644+57,
we find that the super-Eddington disk geometry is preferred over the thin disk,

the cost of heavy computation. Recent works make use of deep neural networks to
accelerate this process, by improving either low-resolution or fewer-sample

considered separately in previous work. We show in this work that Monte Carlo
path tracing can be further accelerated by joint super-resolution and denoising

low-resolution and fewer-sample (thus noisy) image to be rendered by path
tracing, which is then fed into a deep neural network to produce a
high-resolution and clean image. The main contribution of this work is a new
end-to-end network architecture, specifically designed for the SRD task. It
contains two cascaded stages with shared components. We discover that denoising

automatic diagnosis of MVI is the accurate segmentation of vessels. The unique

attractive targets for exploring their atmospheres and formation processes.
Recent studies suggested that the large radii of super-puffs may be caused by
atmospheric dust entrained in the escaping atmospheres. In this study, we
investigate how the dust grows in escaping atmospheres and influence the
transit radii using a microphysical model of grain growth. Collision growth is
efficient in many cases, leading to hinder the upward transport of dust via
enhanced gravitational settling. We find that dust abundance in the outflow
hardly exceeds the Mach number at the dust production region. Thus, dust formed
at upper atmospheres, say $P\lesssim{10}^{-5}$ bar, are needed to launch a
dusty outflow with high dust abundance. With sufficiently high dust production
altitudes and rates, the dusty outflow can enhance the observable radius by a
factor of $\sim$2 or even more. We suggest that photochemical haze is a
promising candidate of high-altitude dust that can be entrained in the outflow.
We also compute the synthetic transmission spectra of super-puff atmospheres
and demonstrate that the dusty outflow produces a broad spectral slope and
obscures molecular features, in agreement with recently reported featureless
spectra. Lastly, using an interior structure model, we suggest that the
atmospheric dust could drastically enhance the observable radius only for
planets in a narrow mass range of $\sim2$--$5M_{\rm \oplus}$, in which the
boil-off tends to cause total atmospheric loss. This may explain why

performs motion correction and super resolution for cardiac image
segmentations. Given a low-resolution segmentation as input, the framework
accounts for inter-slice motion in cardiac MR imaging and super-resolves the
input into a high-resolution segmentation consistent with input. A multi-view
loss is incorporated to leverage information from both short-axis view and
long-axis view of cardiac imaging. To solve the inverse problem, iterative
optimisation is performed in a latent space, which ensures the anatomical
plausibility. This alleviates the need of paired low-resolution and
high-resolution images for supervised learning. Experiments on two cardiac MR

images with various degradations are super-resolved by the same set of weights.
However, degradations of real images are various and unknown (\ie blind SR). It

branches, namely internal branch (IB) and external branch (EB). IB could learn
the specific degradation of the given test LR image, and EB could learn to
super resolve images degraded by the learned degradation. In this way, ONSR
could customize a specific model for each test image, and thus could be more

time-resolved photometric and spectroscopic observations of CzeV404 Her. We
applied our light-curve modelling techniques and the Doppler tomography method

super-resolution and image denoising. Total variation (TV) regularization is
adopted in many image processing applications to preserve the local smoothness.
However, TV prior is prone to oversmoothness, staircasing effect, and contrast
losses. Nonlocal TV (NLTV) mitigates the contrast losses by adaptively
weighting the smoothness based on the similarity measure of image patches.
Although it suppresses the noise effectively in the flat regions, it might
leave residual noise surrounding the edges especially when the image is not
oversmoothed. To address this problem, we propose the bilateral spectrum
weighted total variation (BSWTV). Specially, we apply a locally adaptive shrink
coefficient to the image gradients and employ the eigenvalues of the covariance
matrix of the weighted image gradients to effectively refine the weighting map

derived from a mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise model, the objective function is

list being a linearly ordered list of ties. Ties are subsets of vertices
equally good for a given vertex. An edge $(x,y) \in E \backslash M$ is a
blocking edge for a matching $M$ if by getting matched to each other neither of
the vertices $x$ and $y$ would become worse off. Thus, there is no disadvantage
if the two vertices would like to match up. A matching $M$ is super-stable if
there is no blocking edge with respect to $M$. It has previously been shown
that super-stable matchings form a distributive lattice and the number of
super-stable matchings can be exponential in the number of vertices. We give
two compact representations of size $O(m)$ that can be used to construct all
super-stable matchings, where $m$ denotes the number of edges in the graph. The
construction of the second representation takes $O(mn)$ time, where $n$ denotes
the number of vertices in the graph, and gives an explicit rotation poset

recent years. However, the large volume of intermediate results generated
during inference poses a significant challenge to the accelerator design for
resource-constraint FPGA. Due to the limited on-chip storage, partial results
of intermediate layers are frequently transferred back and forth between
on-chip memory and off-chip DRAM, leading to a non-negligible increase in
latency and energy consumption. In this paper, we propose block convolution, a
hardware-friendly, simple, yet efficient convolution operation that can
completely avoid the off-chip transfer of intermediate feature maps at
run-time. The fundamental idea of block convolution is to eliminate the
dependency of feature map tiles in the spatial dimension when spatial tiling is
used, which is realized by splitting a feature map into independent blocks so
that convolution can be performed separately on individual blocks. We conduct
extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed block
convolution on both the algorithm side and the hardware side. Specifically, we
evaluate block convolution on 1) VGG-16, ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and MobileNet-V1

the high dimensionality and super sparsity of the data collected in these
tasks, handcrafting cross features is inevitably time expensive. Prior studies
in predicting user response leveraged the feature interactions by enhancing
feature vectors with products of features to model second-order or high-order
cross features, either explicitly or implicitly. Nevertheless, these existing
methods can be hindered by not learning sufficient cross features due to model
architecture limitations or modeling all high-order feature interactions with

massive communication traffic. To train high dimensional machine learning
models (such as CNN models), heavy communication traffic can be incurred by
exchanging model updates via the Internet between clients and the parameter
server (PS), implying that the network resource can be easily exhausted.
Compressing model updates is an effective way to reduce the traffic amount.
However, a flexible unbiased compression algorithm applicable for both uplink

work, we devise the Model Update Compression by Soft Clustering (MUCSC)
algorithm to compress model updates transmitted between clients and the PS. In
MUCSC, it is only necessary to transmit cluster centroids and the cluster ID of

unbiased estimation of their original values so that the convergence rate by
transmitting compressed model updates is unchanged; 2) MUCSC can guarantee that

Then, we further propose the boosted MUCSC (B-MUCSC) algorithm, a biased

challenge of active thermography is to overcome the spatial resolution
limitation imposed by heat diffusion in order to accurately resolve each
defect. The photothermal SR approach enables to extract high-frequency spatial
components based on the deconvolution with the thermal point spread function.
However, stable deconvolution can only be achieved by using the sparse
structure of defect patterns, which often requires tedious, hand-crafted tuning

account, Photothermal-SR-Net is proposed in this paper, which performs
deconvolution by deep unfolding considering the underlying physics. This

substantially improved convergence rate. Since defects appear sparsely in
materials, Photothermal-SR-Net applies trained block-sparsity thresholding to
the acquired thermal images in each convolutional layer. The performance of the

considering the effect of 3D directional antennas at both access points (APs)

user itself, moving humans, and wall blockers in a 3D environment. Under such
consideration, we develop a tractable analytical framework to derive a new
expression for the coverage probability by examining the regions where dominant
interferers (i.e., those can cause outage by themselves) can exist, and the
average number of interferers existing in these regions. Aided by numerical
results, we validate our analysis and reveal that ignoring the impact of the
vertical heights of THz devices in the analysis leads to a substantial
underestimation of the coverage probability. We also show that it is more
worthwhile to increase the antenna directivity at the APs than at the UEs, to

development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs have been
successfully employed to improve the quality of endomicroscopy imaging. Yet,
the inherent limitation of research on SR in endomicroscopy remains the lack of
ground truth high-resolution (HR) images, commonly used for both supervised
training and reference-based image quality assessment (IQA). Therefore,
alternative methods, such as unsupervised SR are being explored. To address the
need for non-reference image quality improvement, we designed a novel zero-shot
super-resolution (ZSSR) approach that relies only on the endomicroscopy data to
be processed in a self-supervised manner without the need for ground-truth HR
images. We tailored the proposed pipeline to the idiosyncrasies of
endomicroscopy by introducing both: a physically-motivated Voronoi downscaling
kernel accounting for the endomicroscope's irregular fibre-based sampling
pattern, and realistic noise patterns. We also took advantage of video
sequences to exploit a sequence of images for self-supervised zero-shot image
quality improvement. We run ablation studies to assess our contribution in
regards to the downscaling kernel and noise simulation. We validate our
methodology on both synthetic and original data. Synthetic experiments were
assessed with reference-based IQA, while our results for original images were
evaluated in a user study conducted with both expert and non-expert observers.
The results demonstrated superior performance in image quality of ZSSR

Many machine-learning-based HSI super-resolution (SR) algorithms have been

approaches is that they are highly dependent on image and camera settings and
can only learn to map an input HSI with one specific setting to an output HSI
with another. However, different cameras capture images with different spectral
response functions and bands numbers due to the diversity of HSI cameras.
Consequently, the existing machine-learning-based approaches fail to learn to
super-resolve HSIs for a wide variety of input-output band settings. We propose
a single Meta-Learning-Based Super-Resolution (MLSR) model, which can take in
HSI images at an arbitrary number of input bands' peak wavelengths and generate
SR HSIs with an arbitrary number of output bands' peak wavelengths. We leverage

Our approach is based on linear overparameterization of CNNs and creates an

hydrogen/helium envelopes, consisting of a few to ten percent of their total
mass, from the primordial gas disk. Subsequently, hydrodynamic escape driven by
core-powered mass-loss and/or photo-evaporation likely stripped much of these
primordial envelopes from the lower-mass and closer-in planets to form the
super-Earth population. In this work we show that after undergoing core-powered
mass-loss, some super-Earths can retain small residual H/He envelopes. This
retention is possible because, for significantly depleted atmospheres, the
density at the radiative-convective boundary drops sufficiently such that thhe
cooling time-scale becomes less than the mass-loss time-scale. The residual
envelope is therefore able to contract, terminating further mass loss. Using
analytic calculations and numerical simulations, we show that the mass of
primordial H/He envelope retained as a fraction of the planet's total mass,
$f_{ret}$, increases with increasing planet mass, $M_{c}$, and decreases with
increasing equilibrium temperature, $T_{eq}$, scaling as $f_{ret} \propto
M_{c}^{3/2} T_{eq}^{-1/2} \exp{[M_{c}^{3/4} T_{eq}^{-1}]}$. $f_{ret}$ varies
from $< 10^{-8}$ to about $10^{-3}$ for typical super-Earth parameters. To
first order, the exact amount of left-over H/He depends on the initial envelope
mass, the planet mass, its equilibrium temperature, and the envelope's opacity.
These residual hydrogen envelopes reduce the atmosphere's mean molecular weight
compared to a purely secondary atmosphere, a signature observable by current
and future facilities. These remnant atmospheres may, however, in many cases be
vulnerable to long-term erosion by photo-evaporation. Any residual hydrogen

Neglecting those domain gaps would lead to inferior face super-resolution (FSR)
performance. However, how to transfer a trained FSR model to a target domain
efficiently and effectively has not been investigated. To tackle this problem,
we develop a Domain-Aware Pyramid-based Face Super-Resolution network, named

the decoder of our DAP-FSR. The decoder will generate new face images
resembling the target domain image style. The generated HR faces in turn are
used to optimize our decoder to reduce the domain gap. By iteratively updating
the latent representations and our decoder, our DAP-FSR will be adapted to the

sector. The inequivalent graded Lie (super)algebras are obtained by solving the
constraints imposed by the respective graded Jacobi identities. A motivation
for this mathematical result is to systematically investigate the properties of
dynamical systems invariant under graded (super)algebras. Recent works only
paid attention to the special case of the one-dimensional ${\mathbb
Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded Poincar\'e superalgebra. As applications, we
are able to extend certain constructions originally introduced for this special
superalgebra to other listed ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded
(super)algebras. We mention, in particular, the notion of ${\mathbb

(both classical worldline sigma models and quantum Hamiltonians). As a further
byproduct we point out that, contrary to ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb

framework based on parallel and series integration of artifact removal and
resolution enhancement. Based on maximum a posterior inference for estimating a
clean low-resolution (LR) input image and a clean high resolution (HR) output
image from down-sampled and compressed observations, we have designed a CISR
architecture consisting of two deep neural network modules: the artifact
reduction module (ARM) and resolution enhancement module (REM). ARM and REM
work in parallel with both taking the compressed LR image as their inputs,
while they also work in series with REM taking the output of ARM as one of its
inputs and ARM taking the output of REM as its other input. A unique property
of our CSIR system is that a single trained model is able to super-resolve LR
images compressed by different methods to various qualities. This is achieved
by exploiting deep neural net-works capacity for handling image degradations,
and the parallel and series connections between ARM and REM to reduce the
dependency on specific degradations. ARM and REM are trained simultaneously by
the deep unfolding technique. Experiments are conducted on a mixture of JPEG
and WebP compressed images without a priori knowledge of the compression type
and com-pression factor. Visual and quantitative comparisons demonstrate the
superiority of our method over state-of-the-art super resolu-tion methods.Code

of the black holes asymptotic charges associated with the extended
Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group. These include the Poincar\'e charges of energy,
linear momentum, intrinsic angular momentum, and orbital angular momentum or
center-of-mass charge, as well as extensions of these quantities associated
with supertranslations and super-Lorentz transformations, namely supermomentum,
superspin and super center-of-mass charges (also known as soft hair). Since
each emitted quantum has fluctuations that are of order unity, fluctuations in
the black hole's charges grow over the course of the evaporation. We estimate
the scale of these fluctuations using a simple model. The results are, in
Planck units: (i) The black hole position has a uncertainty of $\sim M_i^2$ at
late times, where $M_i$ is the initial mass (previously found by Page). (ii)
The black hole mass $M$ has an uncertainty of order the mass $M$ itself at the
epoch when $M \sim M_i^{2/3}$, well before the Planck scale is reached.
Correspondingly, the time at which the evaporation ends has an uncertainty of
order $\sim M_i^2$. (iii) The supermomentum and superspin charges are not
independent but are determined from the Poincare charges and the super
center-of-mass charges. (iv) The supertranslation that characterizes the super
center-of-mass charges has fluctuations at multipole orders $l$ of order unity
that that are of order unity in Planck units. At large $l$, there is a power

expected to be associated with the formation of Landau levels or the

Strikingly, we find that, in the case of large barrier potentials, the surface
states exhibit pronounced oscillations in the conductance when varying the

all propagating electrons cross the barrier with perfect transmission. In the
case of small and moderate barrier potentials, we also identify a positive
magnetoconductance which is due to the increase of the Fermi surface by tilting
the surface Dirac cone. Moreover, we show that for weak magnetic fields, the
conductance displays a shifted sinusoidal dependence on the field direction

heliospheric magnetic field observed previously by Ulysses, ACE, and STEREO is
created within rarefaction regions where footpoint motion from the source of
fast into slow wind at the Sun creates a magnetic field line connection across
solar wind speed shear. Conversely, when foot-points move from the source of
slow wind into faster wind, a Super-Parker Spiral field structure is formed:
below the Alfven critical point, one-sided transverse field-aligned flows
develop; above the Alfven critical point, the field structure contracts between
adjacent solar wind flows, and the radial field component decreases in
magnitude with distance from the Sun, eventually reversing into a switchback.
The Sub-Parker and Super-Parker Spirals behave functionally as opposites.
Observations from Parker Solar Probe confirm the paucity of switchbacks within
rarefaction regions and immediately outside these rarefaction regions, we
observe numerous switchbacks in the magnetic field that are directly associated
with abrupt transients in solar wind speed. The radial component of the
magnetic field, the speed gradients, radial Alfven speed, and the ratio of the
sound speed to the radial Alfven speed all conform to predictions based on the
Sub-Parker and Super-Parker Spirals within rarefaction regions and solar wind

respect to Super-k, as Supervised k Clusters or in short Super-klust. Similar
to the Super-k algorithm, the Super-klust algorithm covers data with a labeled

overcome the spatial limitation of camera sensors. While significant progress
has been made in single image super-resolution, most algorithms only perform
well on synthetic data, which limits their applications in real scenarios. In
this paper, we study the problem of real-scene single image super-resolution to
bridge the gap between synthetic data and real captured images. We focus on two
issues of existing super-resolution algorithms: lack of realistic training data
and insufficient utilization of visual information obtained from cameras. To
address the first issue, we propose a method to generate more realistic
training data by mimicking the imaging process of digital cameras. For the
second issue, we develop a two-branch convolutional neural network to exploit
the radiance information originally-recorded in raw images. In addition, we
propose a dense channel-attention block for better image restoration as well as
a learning-based guided filter network for effective color correction. Our
model is able to generalize to different cameras without deliberately training
on images from specific camera types. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm can recover fine details and clear structures, and

given by the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) group, though there are proposed
generalizations of its symmetry algebra. Associated with each symmetry is a
charge and a flux, and the values of these charges and their changes can
characterize a spacetime. The charges of the BMS group are relativistic angular
momentum and supermomentum (which includes 4-momentum); the extensions of the
BMS algebra also include generalizations of angular momentum called ""super
angular momentum."" Several different formalisms have been used to define
angular momentum, and they produce nonequivalent expressions for the charge. It
was shown recently that these definitions can be summarized in a two-parameter
family of angular momenta, which we investigate in this paper. We find that
requiring that the angular momentum vanishes in flat spacetime restricts the
two parameters to be equal. If we do not require that the angular momentum
agrees with a common Hamiltonian definition, then we are left with a
one-parameter family of angular momenta that includes the definitions from the
several different formalisms. We then also propose a similar two-parameter
family of super angular momentum. We examine the effect of the free parameters
on the values of the angular momentum and super angular momentum from
nonprecessing binary-black-hole mergers. The definitions of angular momentum
differ at a high post-Newtonian order for these systems, but only when the
system is radiating gravitational waves. The different super-angular-momentum
definitions occur at lower orders, and there is a difference in the change of
super angular momentum even after the gravitational waves pass, which arises

In linear problems, our formulation reduces the problem of learning the
sub-scales to learning the projected element Green's function basis
coefficients. For the purpose of this approximation, a special neural-network
structure - the variational super-resolution N-N (VSRNN) - is proposed. The
VSRNN constructs a super-resolved model of the unresolved scales as a sum of
the products of individual functions of coarse scales and physics-informed

normalizing the input coarse-scale and output sub-scale basis coefficients, the

temporal resolutions. Our key hypothesis is that spectral profiles of pixels in
a super-pixel of an oversegmented image tend to be very similar. Hence, a
scene-adaptive spatial sampling of an hyperspectral scene, guided by its
super-pixel segmented image, is capable of obtaining high-quality
reconstructions. To achieve this, we acquire an RGB image of the scene, compute
its super-pixels, from which we generate a spatial mask of locations where we
measure high-resolution spectrum. The hyperspectral image is subsequently
estimated by fusing the RGB image and the spectral measurements using a
learnable guided filtering approach. Due to low computational complexity of the
superpixel estimation step, our setup can capture hyperspectral images of the
scenes with little overhead over traditional snapshot hyperspectral cameras,
but with significantly higher spatial and spectral resolutions. We validate the
proposed technique with extensive simulations as well as a lab prototype that
measures hyperspectral video at a spatial resolution of $600 \times 900$

interesting but challenging in computer vision due to the high freedom of human

reconstruct a detailed 3D human body from multi-view images combining voxel
super-resolution based on learning the implicit representation. Firstly, the
coarse 3D models are estimated by learning an implicit representation based on
multi-scale features which are extracted by multi-stage hourglass networks from
the multi-view images. Then, taking the low resolution voxel grids which are
generated by the coarse 3D models as input, the voxel super-resolution based on
an implicit representation is learned through a multi-stage 3D convolutional
neural network. Finally, the refined detailed 3D human body models can be
produced by the voxel super-resolution which can preserve the details and
reduce the false reconstruction of the coarse 3D models. Benefiting from the
implicit representation, the training process in our method is memory efficient
and the detailed 3D human body produced by our method from multi-view images is

length $L$=50-500 Mm, temperature $T$=5-30 MK, and density
$\rho$=10$^{-11}$-10$^{-9}$ kg m$^{-3}$. It was found that inclusion of
compressive viscosity along with thermal conductivity significantly enhances
the damping of fundamental mode oscillations in shorter (e.g., $L$=50 Mm) and
super-hot ($T>$10 MK) loops. However, role of the viscosity in damping is
insignificant in longer (e.g., $L$=500 Mm) and hot loops (T$\leq$10 MK) where,
instead, thermal conductivity along with the presence of heating cooling
imbalance plays a dominant role. For the shorter loops at the super-hot regime
of the temperature, increment in loop density substantially enhances damping of
the fundamental modes due to thermal conductivity when the viscosity is absent,
however, when the compressive viscosity is added the increase in density
substantially weakens damping. Thermal conductivity alone is found to play a
dominant role in longer loops at lower temperatures (T$\leq$10 MK), while
compressive viscosity dominates in damping at super-hot temperatures ($T>$10
MK) in shorter loops. The predicted scaling law between damping time ($\tau$)

unpaired electron spins. Our results indicate the super strong paramagnetism or

representations added with top-down pathway in order to detect objects at

during the top-down feature propagation, the coarser feature maps are upsampled

combined stronger semantic features are inputs of detector's headers. However,
simple interpolation methods (e.g. nearest neighbor and bilinear) are still

community lately due to their superiority over graphs in capturing super-dyadic
interactions among entities. In this work, we propose a novel approach for the
partitioning of k-uniform hypergraphs. Most of the existing methods work by
reducing the hypergraph to a graph followed by applying standard graph
partitioning algorithms. The reduction step restricts the algorithms to
capturing only some weighted pairwise interactions and hence loses essential
information about the original hypergraph. We overcome this issue by utilizing
the tensor-based representation of hypergraphs, which enables us to capture
actual super-dyadic interactions. We prove that the hypergraph to graph
reduction is a special case of tensor contraction. We extend the notion of
minimum ratio-cut and normalized-cut from graphs to hypergraphs and show the
relaxed optimization problem is equivalent to tensor eigenvalue decomposition.
This novel formulation also enables us to capture different ways of cutting a
hyperedge, unlike the existing reduction approaches. We propose a hypergraph
partitioning algorithm inspired from spectral graph theory that can accommodate
this notion of hyperedge cuts. We also derive a tighter upper bound on the
minimum positive eigenvalue of even-order hypergraph Laplacian tensor in terms
of its conductance, which is utilized in the partitioning algorithm to
approximate the normalized cut. The efficacy of the proposed method is
demonstrated numerically on simple hypergraphs. We also show improvement for

its radio emission may be enhanced substantially near periastron. This paper
reports observations with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) of HD80606b near its
periastron in an effort to detect radio emissions generated by an electron
cyclotron maser instability in the planet's magnetosphere. The reported
observations are at frequencies between 30 MHz and 78 MHz, and they are
distinguished from most previous radio observations of extrasolar planets by
two factors: (i) They are at frequencies near 50 MHz, much closer to the
frequencies at which Jupiter emits (< 40 MHz) and lower than most previously

that ultra-short-period super-Earths can sustain volatile atmospheres, rich in
nitrogen and/or carbon. We compute our model atmospheres in a
radiative-convective equilibrium for a variety of nitrogen-rich cases and
orbital parameters. We demonstrate the effects caused by thermal inversions on

atmospheres with temperatures above 2000 K and C/O $\geq$ 1.0 are prone to
thermal inversions. CN is one of the few molecules that is extremely stable at
large temperatures occurring on the day side of short period super-Earths. The
emission spectrum of such atmospheres will differ substantially from

redshift $z>6$ raises the problem of how such SMBHs can grow up within the
cosmic time ($<1$\,Gyr) from small seed BHs. In this letter, we use the
observations of $14$ Quasars at $z>6.5$ with mass estimates to constrain their
seeds and early growth, by self-consistently considering the spin evolution and
the possibility of super-Eddington accretion. We find that spin plays an
important role in the growth of early SMBHs, and the constraints on seed mass
and super-Eddington accretion fraction strongly depend on the assumed accretion
history. If the accretion is coherent with single (or a small number of)
episode(s), leading to high spins for the majority of accretion time, then the
SMBH growth is relatively slow; and if the accretion is chaotic with many
episodes and in each episode the total accreted mass is much less than the SMBH
mass, leading to moderate/low spins, then the growth is relatively fast. The
constraints on the seed mass and super-Eddington accretion fraction are
degenerate. A significant fraction ($\gtrsim0.1\%-1\%$ in linear scale but
$\sim 3-4$ dex in logarithmic scale for $10^3-10^4 M_\odot$ seeds) of
super-Eddington accretion is required if the seed mass is not

neural networks (AdderNet). Compared with convolutional neural networks,
AdderNet utilizing additions to calculate the output features thus avoid

very hard to directly inherit the existing success of AdderNet on large-scale
image classification to the image super-resolution task due to the different
calculation paradigm. Specifically, the adder operation cannot easily learn the
identity mapping, which is essential for image processing tasks. In addition,
the functionality of high-pass filters cannot be ensured by AdderNet. To this
end, we thoroughly analyze the relationship between an adder operation and the
identity mapping and insert shortcuts to enhance the performance of SR models
using adder networks. Then, we develop a learnable power activation for
adjusting the feature distribution and refining details. Experiments conducted
on several benchmark models and datasets demonstrate that, our image
super-resolution models using AdderNet can achieve comparable performance and
visual quality to that of their CNN baselines with an about 2$\times$ reduction

the neural network as we condition the output on them. Multiple exemplars work
better than a single one. To combine the information from multiple exemplars

O.B.Zaslavskii shows this particle can not move in a asymptotic region in this

impossible. However, recently, Mandar Patil and Tomohiro Harada show this
particle can enter event horizon, turns back and emerges through white hole
event horizon into asymptotic region in other universe. This means super
Penrose process for extremal Kerr white hole is possible. During this progress,
they assume this high energy particle's trajectory is geodesic in Kerr

will change the spacetime background and observe different effective space-time

show for some rainbow functions, there is a critical energy. If particle's

means super Penrose process for extremal Kerr white hole becomes impossible in

interactions with the circumstellar disk. In this scenario, convergent
migration may occur and lead to the formation of resonant pairs of planets. We
explore the conditions under which convergent migration and resonance capture
take place, and what dynamical consequences can be expected on the dust
distribution surrounding the resonant pair. We combine hydrodynamic
planet--disk interaction models with dust evolution calculations to investigate
the signatures produced in the dust distribution by a pair of planets in
mean-motion resonances. We find that convergent migration takes place when the
outer planet is the more massive. However, convergent migration also depends on
the local properties of the disk, and divergent migration may result as well.
For similar disk parameters, the capture in low degree resonances (e.g., 2:1 or
3:2) is preferred close to the star where the resonance strength can more
easily overcome the tidal torques exerted by the gaseous disk. Farther away
from the star, convergent migration may result in capture in high degree
resonances. The dust distribution shows potentially observable features
typically when the planets are trapped in a 2:1 resonance. In other cases, with
higher degree resonances (e.g., 5:4 or 6:5) dust features may not be
sufficiently pronounced to be easily observable. The degree of resonance
established by a pair of super-Earths may be indicative of the location in the

zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) mass Mzams/Msun = 300-3000 and metallicity Z/Zsun

gas mixes between $\Delta$QFM -1.19 to +2.06 in a system containing andesitic
melt saturated with opx or cpx only. To produce large (100-150 $\mu$m),
homogeneous pyroxenes, we employed a dynamic cooling technique with a
5-10$\deg$C/h cooling rate, and initial and final dwell temperatures
5-10$\deg$C and 20-30$^\circ$C super and sub-liquidus, respectively. Resulting
pyroxene crystals have absolute variation in Al$_2$O$_3$ and TiO$_2$ <0.05 wt.%
and <0.02 wt.%, respectively. Fe$^{3+}$/Fe$^T$ in pyroxenes and quenched glass
were measured by XANES. We used a newly developed XANES calibration for cpx and
opx by only selecting spectra with X-ray vibrating on the optic axial plane at
$50 \pm 5^\circ$ to the crystallographic c axis. Values of DFe$^{3+}$ cpx/melt
increase from 0.03 to 0.53 as fO2 increases from $\Delta$QFM -0.44 to 2.06,
while DFe$^{3+}$ opx/melt remains unchanged at 0.26 between $\Delta$QFM -1.19
to +1.37. In comparison to natural peridotitic pyroxenes, Fe$^{3+}$/FeT in
pyroxenes crystallized in this study are lower at similar f$_{O2}$, presumably
owing to lower Al$^{3+}$ contents. This study shows that the existing
thermodynamic models implemented in pMELTS and Perple_X over-predict the
stability of Fe$^{3+}$ in pyroxenes, causing an anomalous reduced character to

Thorne-\.Zytkow Object (T\.ZO) candidate HV2112. Using light curves from

luminosities $\log$(L/L$_\odot$) $>$ 4.3, variability periods $>$ 400 days, and
variability amplitudes $\Delta$V $>$ 2.5 mag. Eleven of these stars possess the
distinctive double-peaked light curve morphology of HV2112. We use the
pulsation properties and derived occurrence rates for these 12 objects to
constrain their nature. From comparisons to stellar populations and models, we
find that one star may be a red supergiant with large amplitude pulsations. For
the other 11 stars we derive current masses of $\sim$5-10 M$_{\odot}$, below
the theoretical minimum mass of $\sim$15 M$_{\odot}$ for T\.ZOs to be stable,

luminosities, mass-loss rates, and periods of these stars are consistent with
predictions for super-Asymptotic Giant Branch (s-AGB) stars that have begun
carbon burning but have not reached the superwind phase. We infer lifetimes in
this phase of $\sim($1$-$7) $\times$ 10$^{4}$ years, also consistent with an

to the correct answer. So far, most successful attempts in VQA have been
focused on only one aspect, either the interaction of visual pixel features of
images and word features of questions, or the reasoning process of answering
the question in an image with simple objects. In this paper, we propose a deep
reasoning VQA model with explicit visual structure-aware textual information,
and it works well in capturing step-by-step reasoning process and detecting a
complex object-relationship in photo-realistic images. REXUP network consists
of two branches, image object-oriented and scene graph oriented, which jointly
works with super-diagonal fusion compositional attention network. We
quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate REXUP on the GQA dataset and conduct

  Rapid disk clearing by photoevaporation yields low-mass super-Earth

by mass). However, the origins of super-Earth atmospheres have not yet been
ascertained. We investigate the role of rapid disk clearing by photoevaporation
during the formation of super-Earths and their atmospheres. We perform unified
simulations of super-Earth formation and atmospheric evolution in evolving
disks that consider both photoevaporative winds and magnetically driven disk
winds. For the growth mode of planetary cores, we consider two cases in which
planetary embryos grow with and without pebble accretion. Our main findings are
summarized as follows. (i) The time span of atmospheric accretion is shortened
by rapid disk dissipation due to photoevaporation, which prevents super-Earth
cores from accreting massive atmospheres. (ii) Even if planetary cores grow
rapidly by embryo accretion in the case without pebble accretion, the onset of
runaway gas accretion is delayed because the isolation mass for embryo
accretion is small. Together with rapid disk clearing, the accretion of massive
atmospheres can be avoided. (iii) After rapid disk clearing, a number of
high-eccentricity embryos can remain in outer orbits. Thereafter, such embryos
may collide with the super-Earths, leading to efficient impact erosion of
accreted atmospheres. We, therefore, find that super-Earths with low-mass
H$_2$/He atmospheres are naturally produced by N-body simulations that consider
realistic disk evolution.",astro-ph.EP,cat:quant-ph,all:super%20conducting

revolutionized our understanding of disordered media. After stimulating decades
of lively studies, Anderson localization has found intriguing applications in
various areas of physics, such mesoscopic physics, strongly-correlated systems,
light localization, cavity quantum electrodynamics, random lasers, and
topological phases of matter. However, a fundamental assumption in Andersons
treatment is that no energy is exchanged with the environment, in contrast to
the common knowledge that every real system is subject to dissipation.
Recently, a growing number of theoretical studies has addressed disordered
media with dissipation. In particular it has been predicted that in such
systems all eigenstates exponentially localize, similar to the original case
without dissipation that Anderson considered. However, in dissipative systems
an eigenstate analysis is insufficient for characterizing the transport
dynamics of wave, in stark contrast to Hermitian systems, where the
localization of all eigenstates necessarily suppresses transport. In our work,
we show in theory and experiment that systems with dissipative disorder allow
for a new type of spatial transport, despite the fact that all eigenstates are
exponentially localized. This Anderson transport is characterized by
super-diffusive spreading and ultra-far spatial jumps between localized states.

investigated. ITR predicted by DMM is on the order of 10-9 m2K/W. Using this
ITR, UO2-BeO thermal conductivities are calculated by theoretical models and
compared with experimental data. The results indicate that DMM prediction is
applicable to the interface between UO2 and dispersed BeO, while not applicable
to the interface between UO2 and continuous BeO. If the thermal conductivity of
UO2 containing continuous BeO was to be in agreement with experimental data,
its ITR should be on the order of 10-6 - 10-5 m2K/W. Therefore, the vibrational
mismatch between UO2 and BeO considered by DMM is the major mechanism for
attenuating the heat flux through UO2/dispersed-BeO interface, but not for
UO2/continuous-BeO interface. Furthermore, it is found that the presence of ITR
leads to the dependence of the thermal conductivity of UO2 containing dispersed
BeO on BeO size. With the decrease in BeO size, UO2-BeO thermal conductivity
decreases. When BeO size is smaller than a critical value, UO2-BeO thermal

in the size of UO2 granule surrounded by BeO, but not necessarily smaller than

spreading. However to stop disease spreading, contact tracing requires both
significant visibility (at least 60%) into the proximity graph and the ability
to place half of the population under isolation. We find that pro-actively
isolating super-links -- key proximity encounters -- has significant benefits:
targeted isolation of a fourth of the population based on 35% visibility into

super-spreaders is more effective than contact tracing and testing but less
effective than targeting super-links. We highlight the important role of

thermal conductivity in polymer composites. It is shown from numerical
simulations that maximizing interfacial area between filler and polymer
enhances very significantly the effective thermal conductivity in composites.
Our study outlines two main facts. (a) Although the nature of the filler's
geometry plays an important role in the effective thermal conductivity, we show
that among the different geometries thermal conductivity is high for those
geometries for which the ratio of surface-area to volume is high. Thus
non-spherical shaped fillers show high thermal conductivity compared to the
spherical fillers. (b) For fillers of a particular geometry, by maximizing its
surface area without changing the volume fraction of the metallic filler, the
effective thermal conductivity increases. Thus, the interfacial area between
filler and polymer plays an important role in the enhancement of thermal
conductivity. Maximizing interfaces facilitates more routes for heat conduction
through the metallic filler. Thus filler material can be transformed to result
into more surface such that more interfaces between the filer polymer can be
obtained. It is also observed that as this interfacial area increases, increase
in effective thermal conductivity follows from linear to the logarithmic
growth. It should be noted that to inherit the polymer properties there is a
restriction on the upper bound of volume fraction of the fillers. The current
study bring out an important step in this direction. Our results are
technologically very important in designing composite polymers for better heat
conduction, and are very cost-effective. This study also provides a connection

2018), ASTERIA conducted opportunistic science observations which included
collection of photometric data on 55 Cancri, a nearby exoplanetary system with
a super-Earth transiting planet. The 55 Cancri data were reduced using a custom
pipeline to correct CMOS detector column-dependent gain variations. A Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach was used to simultaneously detrend the
photometry using a simple baseline model and fit a transit model. ASTERIA made
a marginal detection of the known transiting exoplanet 55 Cancri e

first detection of an exoplanet transit by a CubeSat. The successful detection

because the texture details of different images vary greatly. To tackle this
difficulty, we develop a super resolution network with receptive field block

are listed as follows. First, for the purpose of extracting multi-scale

field block (RFB) to super resolution. RFB has achieved competitive results in
object detection and classification. Second, instead of using large convolution
kernels in multi-scale receptive field block, several small kernels are used in
RFB, which makes us be able to extract detailed features and reduce the
computation complexity. Third, we alternately use different upsampling methods
in the upsampling stage to reduce the high computation complexity and still
remain satisfactory performance. Fourth, we use the ensemble of 10 models of
different iteration to improve the robustness of model and reduce the noise

in natal disks around low-mass stars, whereas exoplanets' mass distribution
indicates that some cores have transformed into gas giants through runaway gas
accretion at 1AU from solar-type stars. In this paper, we show that transition
to runaway gas accretion by cores may be self-impeded by an increase of the
grain opacity in their envelope after they have acquired sufficient mass
(typically 10Mearth) to enter a pebble-isolation phase. The accumulation of
mm-m size pebbles in their migration barriers enhances their local
fragmentation rates. The freshly produced sub-mm grains pass through the
barrier, elevate the effective dust opacity and reduce the radiative flux in
the cores envelope. These effects alone are adequate to suppress the transition
to runaway accretion and preserve super-Earths in the stellar proximity (0.1
AU), albeit entropy advection between the envelope and the disk can further
reduce the accretion rate. At intermediate distance (1AU) from their host
stars, the escalation in the dust opacity dominates over entropy advection in
stalling the transition to runaway accretion for marginally pebble-isolated
cores. Beyond a few AU, the transformation of more massive cores to gas giants
is reachable before severe depletion of disk gas. This requirement can be
satisfied either in extended disks with large scale height via orderly
accretion of migrating pebbles or through the mergers of oligarchic
protoplanetary embryos, and can account for the correlated occurrence of

electron-phonon fluid, focusing on electronic transport under the conditions of
strong phonon drag. This regime occurs when the rate of phonon equilibration
due to e.g. umklapp scattering is much slower than the rate of normal
electron-phonon collisions. Then phonons and electrons form a coupled
out-of-equilibrium state where the total quasi-momentum of the electron-phonon
fluid is conserved. A joint flow-velocity emerges as a collective hydrodynamic
variable. We derive the equation of motion for this fluid from the underlying
microscopic kinetic theory and elucidate its effective viscosity and thermal
conductivity. In particular, we derive decay times of arbitrary harmonics of
the distribution function and reveal its corresponding super-diffusive
relaxation on the Fermi surface. We further consider several applications of
this theory to magneto-transport properties in the Hall-bar and Corbino-disk
geometries, relevant to experiments. In our analysis we allow for general
boundary conditions that cover the crossover from no-slip to no-stress flows.
Our approach also covers a crossover from the Stokes to the Ohmic regime under

dependence of the surface impedance and non-equilibrium noise. For the latter,
we notice that in the diffusive regime, a Fokker-Planck approximation, applied
to the electron-phonon collision integral in the Eliashberg form, reduces it to
a differential operator with Burgers nonlinearity. As a result, the
non-equilibrium distribution function has a shock-wave structure in the energy
domain. The consequence of this behavior for the Fano factor of the noise is

Our scheme involves no coincidence measurement or many-particle interference

results in the generation of many-particle entanglement and the reduction of
measurement sensitivity. When the loss is maximum, the system produces a
many-particle Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, and the phase
measurement becomes impossible due to very high phase uncertainty. In striking

extensively studied and made significant progress by leveraging the advanced
machine learning techniques based on deep convolutional neural networks
(DCNNs). However, there has been limited technical development focusing on
single hyperspectral image super-resolution due to the high-dimensional and
complex spectral patterns in hyperspectral image. In this paper, we make a step
forward by investigating how to adapt state-of-the-art residual learning based
single gray/RGB image super-resolution approaches for computationally efficient
single hyperspectral image super-resolution, referred as SSPSR. Specifically,
we introduce a spatial-spectral prior network (SSPN) to fully exploit the
spatial information and the correlation between the spectra of the
hyperspectral data. Considering that the hyperspectral training samples are
scarce and the spectral dimension of hyperspectral image data is very high, it
is nontrivial to train a stable and effective deep network. Therefore, a group
convolution (with shared network parameters) and progressive upsampling
framework is proposed. This will not only alleviate the difficulty in feature
extraction due to high-dimension of the hyperspectral data, but also make the
training process more stable. To exploit the spatial and spectral prior, we
design a spatial-spectral block (SSB), which consists of a spatial residual
module and a spectral attention residual module. Experimental results on some
hyperspectral images demonstrate that the proposed SSPSR method enhances the
details of the recovered high-resolution hyperspectral images, and outperforms
state-of-the-arts. The source code is available at

indeterminate number of valid solutions. Solving this problem with neural
networks would require access to extensive experience, either presented as a

generation of photo-realistic images, it also produces undesired pattern
artifacts in the super-resolved outputs. In this paper, we show that the root
cause of these pattern artifacts can be traced back to a mismatch between the
pre-training objective of perceptual loss and the super-resolution objective.
To address this issue, we propose to augment the existing perceptual loss
formulation with a novel content loss function that uses the latent features of
a discriminator network to filter the unwanted artifacts across several levels
of adversarial similarity. Further, our modification has a stabilizing effect

However, while most workers use these tools, they still earn less than minimum
wage. We argue that the missing element is guidance on how to use transparency
information. In this paper, we explore how novice workers can improve their
earnings by following the transparency criteria of Super Turkers, i.e., crowd
workers who earn higher salaries on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). We believe
that Super Turkers have developed effective processes for using transparency

However, aerial vehicle detection on super-resolved images remains a
challenging task due to the lack of discriminative information in the

Super-Resolution and Vehicle DetectionNetwork (Joint-SRVDNet) that tries to
generate discriminative, high-resolution images of vehicles fromlow-resolution
aerial images. First, aerial images are up-scaled by a factor of 4x using a
Multi-scaleGenerative Adversarial Network (MsGAN), which has multiple
intermediate outputs with increasingresolutions. Second, a detector is trained
on super-resolved images that are upscaled by factor 4x usingMsGAN architecture
and finally, the detection loss is minimized jointly with the super-resolution
loss toencourage the target detector to be sensitive to the subsequent
super-resolution training. The network jointlylearns hierarchical and
discriminative features of targets and produces optimal super-resolution
results. Weperform both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of our proposed

  Inflation with Nonminimal Couplings",2020-05-01,David I. Kaiser,"We have conducted extensive lattice simulations to study the post-inflation
dynamics of multifield models involving nonminimal couplings. We explore the
parameter dependence of preheating in these models and describe the various
time-scales that control such nonlinear processes as energy transfer,
re-scattering, and the approach to radiation-domination and thermalization. In
the limit of large nonminimal couplings ($\xi_I \sim 100$), we find that
efficient transfer of energy from the inflaton condensate to radiative degrees
of freedom, emergence of a radiation-dominated equation of state, and the onset
of thermalization each consistently occur within $N_{\rm reh} \lesssim 3$
$e$-folds after the end of inflation, largely independent of the values of the
other couplings in the models. The exception is the case of negative
ellipticity, in which there is a misalignment between the dominant direction in
field-space along which the system evolves and the larger of the nonminimal
couplings $\xi_I$. In those cases, the field-space-driven parametric resonance
is effectively shut off. More generally, the competition between the scalar
fields' potential and the field-space manifold structure can yield interesting
phenomena such as two-stage resonances. Despite the explosive particle
production, which can lead to a quick depletion of the background energy
density, the nonlinear processes do not induce any super-horizon correlations
after the end of inflation in these models, which keeps predictions for CMB
observables unaffected by the late-time amplification of isocurvature

rocky super-Earths with masses exceeding 3-4 Mearth. Due to high gravity and
pressures in the mantles of these planets, melting in deep mantle layers can be
suppressed, even if the energy releae due to tidal heating and radioactive
decay is substantial. Here we investigate whether a newly identified heating
mechanism, namely induction heating by the star's magnetic field, can drive
volcanic activity on these planets due to its unique heating pattern in the
very upper part of the mantle. In this region the pressure is not yet high
enough to preclude the melt formation. Methods. Using the super-Earth HD 3167b
as an example, we calculate induction heating in the planet's interiors
assuming an electrical conductivity profile typical of a hot rocky planet and a
moderate stellar magnetic field typical of an old inactive star. Then we use a
mantle convection code (CHIC) to simulate the evolution of volcanic outgassing
with time. Results. We show that although in most cases volcanic outgassing on
HD 3167b is not very significant in the absence of induction heating, including
this heating mechanism changes the picture and leads to a substantial increase

achieve robustness at the cost of sacrificing prediction accuracy. The
undesirable severe drop in accuracy adversely affects the reliability of
machine learning algorithms and prohibits their deployment in realistic
applications. This paper aims to address this dilemma by proposing a novel
preprocessing framework, which we term Robust and Accurate Image
classificatioN(RAIN), to improve the robustness of given CNN classifiers and,
at the same time, preserve their high prediction accuracies. RAIN introduces a
new randomization-enhancement scheme. It applies randomization over inputs to
break the ties between the model forward prediction path and the backward
gradient path, thus improving the model robustness. However, similar to
existing preprocessing-based methods, the randomized process will degrade the
prediction accuracy. To understand why this is the case, we compare the
difference between original and processed images, and find it is the loss of
high-frequency components in the input image that leads to accuracy drop of the
classifier. Based on this finding, RAIN enhances the input's high-frequency
details to retain the CNN's high prediction accuracy. Concretely, RAIN consists
of two novel randomization modules: randomized small circular shift (RdmSCS)
and randomized down-upsampling (RdmDU). The RdmDU module randomly downsamples
the input image, and then the RdmSCS module circularly shifts the input image
along a randomly chosen direction by a small but random number of pixels.
Finally, the RdmDU module performs upsampling with a detail-enhancement model,

find that the degree of global super-rotation in the three-dimensional

rate, our numerical experiments inhabit a regime where global super-rotation
scales geostrophically, and we suggest that the Earth and Mars occupy this

angular momentum conservation, where global super-rotation is independent of
rotation rate. Global super-rotation in our experiments saturates at a value

The approach is suitable for enhancement of the optical signatures produced by
the optical Hall effect in semi-transparent conductive layer structures with
plane parallel interfaces. The physical principle is the constructive
interference of electric field components that undergo multiple optical Hall
effect induced polarization rotations upon multiple light passages through the
conductive layer stack. Tuning one of the cavity parameters, such as the
external cavity thickness, permits shifting of the frequencies of the
constructive interference, and enhancement of the optical signatures produced
by the optical Hall effect can be obtained over large spectral regions. A
cavity-tuning optical stage and gas flow cell are used as examples of
instruments that exploit tuning an external cavity to enhance polarization
changes in a reflected terahertz beam. Permanent magnets are used to provide
the necessary external magnetic field. Conveniently, the highly reflective
surface of a permanent magnet can be used to create the tunable external
cavity. The signal enhancement allows the extraction of the free charge carrier
properties of thin films, and can eliminate the need for expensive
super-conducting magnets. Furthermore, the thickness of the external cavity

applications like group expression recognition in crowd scenarios(station,

is the loss of discriminative feature due to reduced resolution.
Super-resolution method is often used to enhance low-resolution images, but the
performance on FER task is limited when on images of very low resolution. In
this work, inspired by feature super-resolution methods for object detection,
we proposed a novel generative adversary network-based feature level

extracted from images of low resolution and original high resolution. Generator
network G tries to transform features of low-resolution images to more
discriminative ones by making them closer to the ones of corresponding

an effective classification-aware loss re-weighting strategy based on the

iron emission line. Compared to other supergiant HMXBs, the Fe K$\alpha$ line
equivalent width is low in SMC X-1 - from less than 10 eV in high state to up
to $\sim$ 270 eV in the low states. The spectral shape is dependent on flux
with the hard X-ray spectrum steepening with increasing flux. We also report a
highly variable normalisation of the power-law component across these 16

Yet, current automatic designs rely on either reinforcement learning or

the pruning algorithm needs a long searching stage before reaching the
convergence.
  To circumvent this problem, this paper introduces a differentiable pruning
method via hypernetworks for automatic network pruning. The specifically
designed hypernetworks take latent vectors as input and generate the weight
parameters of the backbone network. The latent vectors control the output
channels of the convolutional layers in the backbone network and act as a
handle for the pruning of the layers. By enforcing $\ell_1$ sparsity
regularization to the latent vectors and utilizing proximal gradient solver,
sparse latent vectors can be obtained. Passing the sparsified latent vectors
through the hypernetworks, the corresponding slices of the generated weight
parameters can be removed, achieving the effect of network pruning. The latent
vectors of all the layers are pruned together, resulting in an automatic layer

many MR acquisitions use large inter-slice spacing in clinical practice. In
this work, we propose a novel deep-learning-based super-resolution algorithm to
generate high-resolution (HR) MR images with small slice spacing from
low-resolution (LR) inputs of large slice spacing. Notice that most existing
deep-learning-based methods need paired LR and HR images to supervise the
training, but in clinical scenarios, usually no HR images will be acquired.
Therefore, our unique goal herein is to design and train the super-resolution
network with no real HR ground-truth. Specifically, two training stages are
used in our method. First, HR images of reduced slice spacing are synthesized
from real LR images using variational auto-encoder (VAE). Although these
synthesized HR images are as realistic as possible, they may still suffer from
unexpected morphing induced by VAE, implying that the synthesized HR images
cannot be paired with the real LR images in terms of anatomical structure
details. In the second stage, we degrade the synthesized HR images to generate
corresponding LR images and train a super-resolution network based on these
synthesized HR and degraded LR pairs. The underlying mechanism is that such a
super-resolution network is less vulnerable to anatomical variability.

Several lines of observational evidence indicate that most super-Earths do not

massive atmospheres on super-Earths challenge planet formation theory. We
consider the following three mechanisms: (i) envelope heating by pebble
accretion, (ii) mass loss during giant impacts, and (iii) atmospheric loss by
stellar X-ray and EUV photoevaporation. We investigate whether these mechanisms
influence the amount of the atmospheres that form around super-Earths. We
develop a code combining an N-body simulation of pebble-driven planetary
formation and an atmospheric evolution simulation. We demonstrate that the
observed orbital properties of super-Earths are well reproduced by the results

disk dispersal, (ii) the frequency of giant impact events is too low to sculpt
massive atmospheres, and (iii) many super-Earths having H$_2$/He atmospheres of

Progressive growing enhances image resolution gradually, thereby preserving

in the super-Earth population can arise from giant impacts during planetary
formation. Planet formation simulations have only recently begun to treat
collisions more realistically in an attempt to replicate the planets in our

We track the maximum plausible change in composition after each impact. The
final planets span a range of Fe/Mg ratios similar to the Solar System planets,
but do not completely match the distribution in super-Earth data. We only form
a few planets with minor iron-depletion, suggesting other mechanisms are at
work. The most iron-rich planets have a lower Fe/Mg ratio than Mercury, and are
less enriched than planets such as Kepler-100b. This indicates that further

real-world scenarios where the input image is always contaminated by noise. In
this paper, we propose a Facial Attribute Capsules Network (FACN) to deal with
the problem of high-scale super-resolution of noisy face image. Capsule is a
group of neurons whose activity vector models different properties of the same
entity. Inspired by the concept of capsule, we propose an integrated
representation model of facial information, which named Facial Attribute
Capsule (FAC). In the SR processing, we first generated a group of FACs from
the input LR face, and then reconstructed the HR face from this group of FACs.
Aiming to effectively improve the robustness of FAC to noise, we generate FAC
in semantic, probabilistic and facial attributes manners by means of integrated
learning strategy. Each FAC can be divided into two sub-capsules: Semantic
Capsule (SC) and Probabilistic Capsule (PC). Them describe an explicit facial
attribute in detail from two aspects of semantic representation and probability

smaller super-Earths from larger sub-Neptunes. This can be explained as an
evaporation valley between planets with and without H/He that is caused by
atmospheric escape. First, we conduct numerical simulations of the evolution of
close-in low-mass planets with H/He undergoing escape. Second, we develop an
analytical model for the valley locus. We find that the bottom of the valley
quantified by the radius of the largest stripped core $R_{\rm b}$ at a given
orbital distance depends only weakly on post-formation H/He mass. The reason is
that a high initial H/He mass means that there is more gas to evaporate, but
also that the planet density is lower, increasing loss. Regarding stellar
$L_{\rm XUV}$, $R_{\rm b}$ scales as $L_{\rm XUV}^{0.135}$. The same weak
dependency applies to the efficiency factor $\varepsilon$ of energy-limited
evaporation. As found numerically and analytically, $R_{\rm b}$ varies as
function of orbital period $P$ for a constant $\varepsilon$ as $P^{-2 p_{\rm
c}/3}\approx P^{-0.18}$ where $M \propto R^{p_{\rm c}}$ is the mass-radius
relation of solid cores. $R_{\rm b}$ is about 1.7 $R_{\oplus}$ at a 10-day
orbit for an Earth-like composition, increasing linearly with ice mass
fraction. The numerical results are explained very well with the analytical
model where complete evaporation occurs if the temporal integral over the
stellar XUV irradiation absorbed by the planet is larger than binding energy of
the envelope in the gravitational potential of the core. The weak dependency on
primordial H/He mass, $L_{\rm XUV}$ and $\varepsilon$ explains why
observationally the valley is visible, and why theoretically models find
similar results. At the same time, given the large observed spread of $L_{\rm
XUV}$, the dependency on it is still strong enough to explain why the valley is
not completely empty.",astro-ph.EP,cat:quant-ph,all:super%20conducting

iron-atom orbitals. Low-energy hidden spin fluctuations at the checkerboard
wavevector Q_AF result from nested Fermi surfaces at the center and at the
corner of the unfolded (one-iron) Brillouin zone. Magnetic frustration from
super-exchange interactions via the selenium atoms stabilize hidden spin
fluctuations at Q_AF versus true spin fluctuations. At half filling, Eliashberg
theory based purely on the exchange of hidden spin fluctuations reveals a
Lifshitz transition to electron/hole Fermi surface pockets at the corner of the
folded (two-iron) Brillouin zone, but with vanishing spectral weights. The
underlying hidden spin-density wave groundstate is therefore a Mott insulator.
Upon electron doping, Eliashberg theory finds that the spectral weights of the
hole Fermi surface pockets remain vanishingly small, while the spectral weights
of the larger electron Fermi surface pockets become appreciable. This
prediction is therefore consistent with the observation of electron Fermi
surface pockets alone in electron-doped iron selenide by angle-resolved

dichotomy between single transiting and multiple transiting system. We simulate
in situ formation of super-Earths via giant impacts and compare to the observed

function minimization in machine learning. This method is often used with
`Nesterov acceleration', meaning that the gradient is evaluated not at the
current position in parameter space, but at the estimated position after one
step. In this work, we show that the algorithm can be improved by extending
this `acceleration' --- by using the gradient at an estimated position several
steps ahead rather than just one step ahead. How far one looks ahead in this
`super-acceleration' algorithm is determined by a new hyperparameter.
Considering a one-parameter quadratic loss function, the optimal value of the
super-acceleration can be exactly calculated and analytically estimated. We
show explicitly that super-accelerating the momentum algorithm is beneficial,
not only for this idealized problem, but also for several synthetic loss
landscapes and for the MNIST classification task with neural networks.
Super-acceleration is also easy to incorporate into adaptive algorithms like
RMSProp or Adam, and is shown to improve these algorithms.",cs.LG,cat:quant-ph,all:super%20conducting

10^{5}~M_{\odot}$ is a promising scenario for the origin of high-redshift
supermassive black holes. It has usually been supposed that the DCBH can only
form in the primordial gas since the metal enrichment enhances the cooling
ability and causes the fragmentation into smaller pieces. What actually happens
in such an environment, however, has not been explored in detail. Here, we
study the impact of the metal enrichment on the clouds, conducting
hydrodynamical simulations to follow the cloud evolution in cases with
different degree of the metal enrichment $Z/Z_{\odot}=10^{-6}-10^{-3}$. Below
$Z/Z_{\odot}=10^{-6}$, metallicity has no effect and supermassive stars form
along with a small number of low-mass stars. With more metallicity $Z/Z_{\odot}
\gtrsim 5 \times 10^{-6}$, although the dust cooling indeed promotes
fragmentation of the cloud core and produces about a few thousand low-mass
stars, the accreting flow preferentially feeds the gas to the central massive
stars, which grows supermassive as in the primordial case. We term this
formation mode as the {\it super competitive accretion}, where only the central
few stars grow supermassive while a large number of other stars are competing
for the gas reservoir. Once the metallicity exceeds $10^{-3}~Z_{\odot}$ and
metal-line cooling becomes operative, the central star cannot grow supermassive
due to lowered accretion rate. Supermassive star formation by the super
competitive accretion opens up a new window for seed BHs, which relaxes the
condition on metallicity and enhances the seed BH abundance.",astro-ph.GA,cat:quant-ph,all:super%20conducting

the warp grid needed for motion compensation, which is specified by the two

vulnerable to runaway accretion and hydrodynamic escape. Here we propose that
high altitude photochemical hazes could enhance the observed radii of low-mass
planets and explain the nature of super-puffs. We construct model atmospheres
in radiative-convective equilibrium and compute rates of atmospheric escape and
haze distributions, taking into account haze coagulation, sedimentation,
diffusion, and advection by an outflow wind. We develop mass-radius diagrams
that include atmospheric lifetimes and haze opacity, which is enhanced by the
outflow, such that young (~0.1-1 Gyr), warm (T$_{eq}$ $\geq$ 500 K), low mass
objects ($M_c$ < 4M$_{\rm Earth}$) should experience the most apparent radius
enhancement due to hazes, reaching factors of three. This reconciles the
densities and ages of the most extreme super-puffs. For Kepler-51b, the
inclusion of hazes reduces its inferred gas mass fraction to <10%, similar to
that of planets on the large radius side of the sub-Neptune radius gap. This
suggests that Kepler-51b may be evolving towards that population, and that some
warm sub-Neptunes may have evolved from super-puffs. Hazes also render
transmission spectra of super-puffs and sub-Neptunes featureless, consistent
with recent measurements. Our hypothesis can be tested by future observations

rate-performance in battery electrodes, this relationship has been quantified

electrode conductivity and rate-performance in
Lithium-Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt-Oxide (NMC) cathodes filled with various
quantities of carbon black, single-walled carbon nanotubes and graphene. The
electrode conductivity is always extremely anisotropic with the out-of-plane
conductivity, which is most relevant to rate-performance, roughly 1000 smaller
than the in-plane conductivity. For all fillers the conductivity increases with
filler loading although the nanotube-filled electrodes show by far the most
rapid increase. Fitting capacity versus rate curves yielded the characteristic
time associated with charge/discharge. This parameter increased linearly with
the inverse of the out-of-plane conductivity, with all data points falling on
the same master curve. Using a simple mechanistic model for the characteristic
time, we develop an equation which matches the experimental data almost
perfectly with no adjustable parameters. This implies that increasing the
electrode conductivity improves the rate-performance by decreasing the RC
charging time of the electrode. This model shows the effect of electrode
resistance on the rate-performance to become negligible in almost all cases

hosting ""cold Jupiters"" (giant planets with $a\gtrsim 1\,\mathrm{AU}$) almost
always host ""inner super-Earths"" (1-$4\,R_\oplus$, $a\lesssim1\,\mathrm{AU}$).
Here, we attempt to determine the degree of alignment between the orbital
planes of the cold Jupiters and the inner super-Earths. The key observational
input is the fraction of Kepler stars with transiting super-Earths that also
have transiting cold Jupiters. This fraction depends on both the probability
for cold Jupiters to occur in such systems, and on the mutual orbital
inclinations. Since the probability of occurrence has already been measured in
Doppler surveys, we can use the data to constrain the dispersion of the mutual
inclination distribution. We find $\sigma=11.8^{+12.7}_{-5.5}\,\mathrm{deg}$
(68% confidence) and $\sigma>3.5\,\mathrm{deg}$ (95% confidence), where
$\sigma$ is the scale parameter of the Rayleigh distribution. This suggests
that planetary orbits in systems with cold Jupiters tend to be coplanar -
although not quite as coplanar as those in the Solar System, which have a mean
inclination from the invariable plane of $1.8\,\mathrm{deg}$. We also find
evidence that cold Jupiters have lower mutual inclinations relative to inner
systems with higher transit multiplicity. This suggests a link between the
dynamical excitation in the inner and outer systems. For example, perturbations
from misaligned cold Jupiters may dynamically heat or destabilize systems of
inner super-Earths.",astro-ph.EP,cat:quant-ph,all:super%20conducting

However, realizing robust ferromagnetic couplings that can survive at high

Such evolution originates from the enhanced electron hopping integral and

careful theoretical treatments. Using semiconducting monolayers of transition
metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) as prototypical systems affected by electrostatic
gating, we show that the electronic and optical properties change indeed
dramatically when the gating geometry is properly taken into account. This
effect is implemented by a self-consistent calculation of the Coulomb
interaction between the charges in different sub-layers within the
tight-binding approximation. Thereby we consider both, single- and double-sided
gating. Our results show that, at low doping levels of $10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$, the
electronic bands of monolayer TMDs shift rigidly for both types of gating, and
subsequently undergo a Lifshitz transition. When approaching the doping level

the case of single-sided gating where we find that monolayer \ce{MoS2} and

beneficial for many applications. Moreover, jointly solving both angular and

field imaging. The conventional method relies on physical-based rendering and a
secondary network to solve the angular super-resolution problem. In addition,
pixel-based loss limits the network capability to infer scene geometry
globally. In this paper, we show that both super-resolution problems can be
solved jointly from a single image by proposing a single end-to-end deep neural
network that does not require a physical-based approach. Two novel loss
functions based on known light field domain knowledge are proposed to enable
the network to preserve the spatio-angular consistency between sub-aperture
images. Experimental results show that the proposed model successfully
synthesizes dense high resolution light field and it outperforms the
state-of-the-art method in both quantitative and qualitative criteria. The

exceptionally large radii for their masses and thus correspondingly low
densities ($\lesssim0.3\rm\,g\,cm^{-3}$). Here we consider whether they could
have large inferred radii because they are in fact ringed. This would naturally
explain why super-puffs have thus far only shown featureless transit spectra.
We find that this hypothesis can work in some cases but not all. The close
proximity of the super-puffs to their parent stars necessitates rings with a
rocky rather than icy composition. This limits the radius of the rings, and
makes it challenging to explain the large size of Kepler 51b, 51c, 51d, and 79d
unless the rings are composed of porous material. Furthermore, the short tidal
locking timescales for Kepler 18d, 223d, and 223e mean that these planets may
be spinning too slowly, resulting in a small oblateness and rings that are
warped by their parent star. Kepler 87c and 177c have the best chance of being
explained by rings. Using transit simulations, we show that testing this
hypothesis requires photometry with a precision of somewhere between ~10 ppm
and ~50 ppm, which roughly scales with the ratio of the planet and star's
radii. We conclude with a note about the recently discovered super-puff HIP

can extract richer feature maps and generate SR images with remarkable quality.
However, the more complex network we have, the more time consumption is
required for practical applications. It is important to have a simplified
network for efficient image SR. In this paper, we propose an Attention based
Back Projection Network (ABPN) for image super-resolution. Similar to some
recent works, we believe that the back projection mechanism can be further
developed for SR. Enhanced back projection blocks are suggested to iteratively
update low- and high-resolution feature residues. Inspired by recent studies on
attention models, we propose a Spatial Attention Block (SAB) to learn the
cross-correlation across features at different layers. Based on the assumption
that a good SR image should be close to the original LR image after
down-sampling. We propose a Refined Back Projection Block (RBPB) for final

liquid behavior to a super-linear behavior as temperature increases. By
applying pressures up to 32.1 GPa, the transition temperature does not show a
clear change and no superconductivity is observed above 2 K. The density

high thermal efficiency is mainly constrained by knock and super-knock
respectively due to the end gas autoignition and detonation development. At the
end of the compression stroke, the pressure wave propagation and reflection in
a small confined space may greatly influence the end gas autoignition, leading
to different autoignition characteristics from those in a large or open space.
The present study investigates the transient autoignition process in an
iso-octane/air mixture inside a closed chamber under engine-relevant
conditions. The emphasis is given to the assessing effects of the pressure
wave-wall reflection and the mechanism of extremely strong pressure
oscillations typical for super-knock. It is found that the hot spot induced
autoignition in a closed chamber can be greatly affected by shock/pressure wave
reflection from the end wall. Different autoignition modes respectively from
the hot spot and end wall reflection are identified. A non-dimensional
parameter quantifying the interplay between different length and time scales is
introduced, which helps to identify different autoignition regimes including
detonation development near the end wall. It is shown that detonation
development from the hot spot may cause super-knock with devastating pressure
oscillation. However, the detonation development from the end wall can hardly
produce pressure oscillation strong enough for the super-knock. The obtained
results provide a fundamental insight into the knocking mechanism in engines

diagnostics. In practice, image resolution is restricted by factors like
hardware and processing constraints. Recently, deep learning methods have been
shown to produce compelling state-of-the-art results for image
enhancement/super-resolution. Paying particular attention to desired
hi-resolution MR image structure, we propose a new regularized network that
exploits image priors, namely a low-rank structure and a sharpness prior to
enhance deep MR image super-resolution (SR). Our contributions are then
incorporating these priors in an analytically tractable fashion \color{black}
as well as towards a novel prior guided network architecture that accomplishes
the super-resolution task. This is particularly challenging for the low rank
prior since the rank is not a differentiable function of the image matrix(and
hence the network parameters), an issue we address by pursuing differentiable
approximations of the rank. Sharpness is emphasized by the variance of the
Laplacian which we show can be implemented by a fixed feedback layer at the
output of the network. As a key extension, we modify the fixed feedback
(Laplacian) layer by learning a new set of training data driven filters that
are optimized for enhanced sharpness. Experiments performed on publicly
available MR brain image databases and comparisons against existing
state-of-the-art methods show that the proposed prior guided network offers
significant practical gains in terms of improved SNR/image quality measures.
Because our priors are on output images, the proposed method is versatile and
can be combined with a wide variety of existing network architectures to
further enhance their performance.",eess.IV,cat:quant-ph,all:super%20conducting

significantly from the thin disk picture. We carry out theoretical
investigations on this topic by focusing on the Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescent lines

shaped by the funnel geometry and wind acceleration. We also systematically
compare the Fe line profiles from super-Eddington thick disks to those from

symmetric in shape. These results are consistent with the observed Fe K$\alpha$

significantly improve the performance of single image super-resolution (SISR).
Numerous studies have concentrated on raising the quantitative quality of
super-resolved (SR) images. However, these methods that target PSNR
maximization usually produce blurred images at large upscaling factor. The
introduction of generative adversarial networks (GANs) can mitigate this issue
and show impressive results with synthetic high-frequency textures.
Nevertheless, these GAN-based approaches always have a tendency to add fake
textures and even artifacts to make the SR image of visually higher-resolution.
In this paper, we propose a novel perceptual image super-resolution method that
progressively generates visually high-quality results by constructing a
stage-wise network. Specifically, the first phase concentrates on minimizing
pixel-wise error, and the second stage utilizes the features extracted by the
previous stage to pursue results with better structural retention. The final
stage employs fine structure features distilled by the second phase to produce
more realistic results. In this way, we can maintain the pixel, and structural
level information in the perceptual image as much as possible. It is useful to
note that the proposed method can build three types of images in a feed-forward

a physical image with its downsampled counterpart. The high-resolution image
covers about 25% of the view field of the low-resolution image, and the
objective is to enhance the area of the low-resolution image where there is no
high-resolution counterpart. The second difference is that the physics behind

implication is that super-resolution models trained by optical photos are not

However, the performance gain from the single-FPGA design is obstructed by the

insufficient bandwidth between the off-chip memory and the accelerator due to
the growing size of DNNs. To tackle these issues, we propose a general

Here we show that the same is not true for algebraic localization. We show, on

Thus, in this phase, the mobility edge separates two kinds of conducting

difficulty of super point detection in multi-node distributed environment is
how to reduce communication overhead. Therefore, this paper proposes a

the nature of the coupling between the atmosphere and the surrounding disc. We
examine the formation of gaseous envelopes around massive planetary cores via
three-dimensional inviscid and isothermal hydrodynamic simulations. We focus
the changes in the envelope properties as the core mass varies from low

super-Earths. We show that global envelope properties such as the amount of
rotational support or turbulent mixing are mostly sensitive to the ratio of the
Bondi radius of the core to its physical size. High-mass cores are fed by
supersonic inflows arriving along the polar axis and shocking on the densest
parts of the envelope, driving turbulence and mass accretion. Gas flows out of
the core's Hill sphere in the equatorial plane, describing a global mass
circulation through the envelope. The shell of shocked gas atop the core
surface delimits regions of slow (inside) and fast (outside) material recycling
by gas from the surrounding disc. While recycling hinders the runaway growth

down to the core surface. Owing to the conservation of vortensity, envelopes
acquire a substantial degree of rotational support when the core mass increases
beyond the thermal mass, suggesting a limited applicability of one-dimensional
models for describing the envelope structure. The finite size of the core
(relatively large for super-Earths) also controls the amount of rotational
support in the entire envelope. Steady non-axisymmetric shocks develop in the
supersonic envelopes of high-mass cores, triggering mass accretion and
turbulent mixing in their interiors. We also examine the influence of the gas

predictions, in general, agree well with experimental data. We find that the
phonon thermal conductivity is in the range of 2 - 18 $W/mK$, which accounts

phonon thermal conductivities in transition metals and
transition-intermetallic-compounds (TICs) are non-negligible compared to noble
metals due to their high phonon group velocities. Besides, the electron-phonon
coupling effect on phonon thermal conductivity in transition metals and
intermetallic compounds is stronger than that of nobles, which is attributed to
the larger electron-phonon coupling constant with a high electron density of
state within Fermi window and high phonon frequency. The noble metals have
higher electron thermal conductivities compared to transition metals and TICs,
which is mainly due to the weak electron-phonon coupling in noble metals. It is
also shown that the Lorenz ratios of transition metals and

outflows. Such outflows are observed in Galactic X-ray binaries and
extragalactic Ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs). However, due to their large
source distances, ULX outflows are challenging to detect and study in detail.
Galactic neutron stars accreting from a Be-star companion at super-Eddington
rates show many similarities to ULX pulsars, and therefore offer an alternative
approach to study outflows in this accretion regime. Here, we present Chandra
high-resolution spectroscopy of such a super-Eddington accreting neutron star,
Swift J0243.6+6124, to search for wind outflow signatures during the peak of
its 2017/2018 giant outburst. We detect narrow emission features at rest from
Ne, Mg, S, Si, and Fe. In addition, we detect a collection of absorption
features which can be identified in two ways: either as all Fe transitions at
rest (with a possible contribution from Mg), or a combination of three
blue-shifted Ne and Mg lines at $\sim 0.22c$, while the remaining lines are at
rest. The second scenario would imply an outflow with a velocity similar to
those seen in ULXs, including the ULX pulsar NGC 300 ULX-1. This result would
also imply that Swift J0243.6+6124 launches both a jet, detected in radio and

  SuperSCRAM",2019-04-26,Christopher M. Hirata,"The observable universe contains density perturbations on scales larger than
any finite volume survey. Perturbations on scales larger than a survey can
measure degrade its power to constrain cosmological parameters. The dependence
of survey observables such as the weak lensing power spectrum on these
long-wavelength modes results in super-sample covariance. Accurately
forecasting parameter constraints for future surveys requires accurately
accounting for the super-sample effects. If super-sample covariance is in fact
a major component of the survey error budget, it may be necessary to
investigate mitigation strategies that constrain the specific realization of
the long-wavelength modes. We present a Fisher matrix based formalism for
approximating the magnitude of super-sample covariance and the effectiveness of
mitigation strategies for realistic survey geometries. We implement our
formalism in the public code SuperSCRAM: Super-Sample Covariance Reduction and
Mitigation. We illustrate SuperSCRAM with an example application, where the
modes contributing to super-sample covariance in the WFIRST weak lensing survey
are constrained by the low-redshift galaxy number counts in the wider LSST
footprint. We find that super-sample covariance increases the volume of the

object. The otherwise inaccessible high-resolution object information can thus
be encoded into the captured images. We then employ a ptychographic phase

the complex wavefront exits the sample - not enters it. Therefore, the sample
thickness becomes irrelevant during reconstruction. After recovery, we can
propagate the super-resolution complex wavefront to any position along the
optical axis. We validate our approach using a resolution target, a
quantitative phase target, a two-layer sample, and a thick PDMS sample. We
demonstrate a 4.5-fold resolution gain over the diffraction limit. We also show

of curvature perturbations on comoving slices $\mathcal{R}$, which can cause
the production of primordial black holes (PBH), is not due to entropy
perturbations, but to the background evolution effect on the conversion between
entropy and curvature perturbations. We derive a general relation between the
time derivative of comoving curvature perturbations and entropy perturbations,
in terms of a conversion factor depending on the background evolution. Contrary
to previous results derived in the uniform density gauge assuming the gradient
term can be neglected on super-horizon scales, the relation is valid on any
scale for any minimally coupled single scalar field model, also on sub-horizon
scales where gradient terms are large.
  We apply it to the case of quasi-inflection inflation, showing that while
entropy perturbations are decreasing, $\mathcal{R}$ can grow on super-horizon
scales, due to a large increase of the conversion factor. This happens in the
time interval during which a sufficiently fast decrease of the equation of

quantity (e.g., perspective depth acquired with a time-of-flight camera) and a
high-resolution guide image from a different domain (e.g., a grey-scale image
from a conventional camera); and the target output is a high-resolution version
of the source (in our example, a high-res depth map). The standard way of
looking at this problem is to formulate it as a super-resolution task, i.e.,
the source image is upsampled to the target resolution, while transferring the
missing high-frequency details from the guide. Here, we propose to turn that
interpretation on its head and instead see it as a pixel-to-pixel mapping of
the guide image to the domain of the source image. The pixel-wise mapping is
parametrised as a multi-layer perceptron, whose weights are learned by
minimising the discrepancies between the source image and the downsampled
target image. Importantly, our formulation makes it possible to regularise only
the mapping function, while avoiding regularisation of the outputs; thus
producing crisp, natural-looking images. The proposed method is unsupervised,
using only the specific source and guide images to fit the mapping. We evaluate

occur both within and across layers, and super-diffusion, a regime where the
time scale of the multiplex to reach equilibrium is smaller than that of single
networks in isolation, can emerge due to the interplay of these two mechanisms.
In the limits of strong and weak inter-layer couplings multiplex diffusion has
been linked to the spectrum of the supra-Laplacian associated to the system.
However, a general theory for the emergence of this behavior is still lacking.
Here we shed light on how the structural and dynamical features of the
multiplex affect the Laplacian spectral properties. For instance, we find that
super-diffusion emerges the earliest in systems with poorly diffusive layers,
and that its onset is independent from the presence of overlap, which only
influences the maximum relative intensity of the phenomenon. Moreover, a
uniform allocation of resources to enhance diffusion within layers is
preferable, as highly intra-layer heterogenous flows might hamper
super-diffusion. Last, in multiplex networks formed by many layers, diffusion
is best promoted by strengthening inter-layer flows across dissimilar layers.

image super-resolution tasks in recent years. However, the network's
performance depends on the distribution of the training sets and degrades on
out-of-distribution samples. This paper adopts a Bayesian approach for
estimating uncertainty associated with output and applies it in a deep image
super-resolution model to address the concern mentioned above. We use the
uncertainty estimation technique using the batch-normalization layer, where
stochasticity of the batch mean and variance generate Monte-Carlo (MC) samples.
The MC samples, which are nothing but different super-resolved images using
different stochastic parameters, reconstruct the image, and provide a
confidence or uncertainty map of the reconstruction. We propose a faster
approach for MC sample generation, and it allows the variable image size during
testing. Therefore, it will be useful for image reconstruction domain. Our
experimental findings show that this uncertainty map strongly relates to the
quality of reconstruction generated by the deep CNN model and explains its
limitation. Furthermore, this paper proposes an approach to reduce the model's
uncertainty for an input image, and it helps to defend the adversarial attacks
on the image super-resolution model. The proposed uncertainty reduction

super-Earths that is interpreted as a signpost that close-in super-Earths are
mostly rocky in composition. However, new models predict that planetesimals
should first form at the water ice line such that close-in planets are expected
to have a significant water ice component. Here we investigate the water
contents of super-Earths by studying the interplay between pebble accretion,
planet migration and disc evolution. Planets' compositions are determined by
their position relative to different condensation fronts (ice lines) throughout
their growth. Migration plays a key role. Assuming that planetesimals start at
or exterior to the water ice line ($r>r_{\rm H_2O}$), inward migration causes
planets to leave the source region of icy pebbles and therefore to have lower
final water contents than in discs with either outward migration or no
migration. The water ice line itself moves inward as the disc evolves, and
delivers water as it sweeps across planets that formed dry. The relative speed
and direction of planet migration and inward drift of the water ice line is
thus central in determining planets' water contents. If planet formation starts
at the water ice line, this implies that hot close-in super-Earths (r<0.3 AU)
with water contents of a few percent are a signpost of inward planet migration
during the early gas phase. Hot super-Earths with larger water ice contents on
the other hand, experienced outward migration at the water ice line and only
migrated inwards after their formation was complete either because they become
too massive to be contained in the region of outward migration or in chains of
resonant planets. Measuring the water ice content of hot super-Earths may thus

previous methods, our key contribution is a multi-level matching conducted in

that allows the model to benefit more from those semantically related Ref
patches, and gracefully degrade to SISR performance on the least relevant Ref

channel state information (CSI) obtainable from commercialized MIMO-OFDM WLAN

search for an answer, we take a bottom-up approach by first understanding CSI,

We then model these effects mathematically. The correctness of these models is
corroborated based on the CSI collected in extensive measurement campaign

contamination in CSI phase and amplitude, we proceed with introducing
pre-processing methods to clean CSI from those errors and make it usable for
range estimation. To check the validity of proposed algorithms, the MUSIC

4 Earth radii and orbital periods of less than 100 days. We use N-body
simulations including a model for gas-assisted pebble accretion and
disk--planet tidal interaction to study the formation of super-Earth systems.
We show that the integrated pebble mass reservoir creates a bifurcation between
hot super-Earths or hot-Neptunes ($\lesssim15M_{\oplus}$) and super-massive
planetary cores potentially able to become gas giant planets
($\gtrsim15M_{\oplus}$). Simulations with moderate pebble fluxes grow multiple
super-Earth-mass planets that migrate inwards and pile up at the inner edge of
the disk forming long resonant chains. We follow the long-term dynamical
evolution of these systems and use the period ratio distribution of observed
planet-pairs to constrain our model. Up to $\sim$95\% of resonant chains become
dynamically unstable after the gas disk dispersal, leading to a phase of late
collisions that breaks the original resonant configurations. Our simulations
naturally match observations when they produce a dominant fraction
($\gtrsim95\%$) of unstable systems with a sprinkling ($\lesssim5\%$) of stable
resonant chains (the Trappist-1 system represents one such example). Our

  the radial pebble flux determines a terrestrial-planet or super-Earth growth
  mode",2019-02-22,Sean N. Raymond,"Super-Earths are found in tighter orbits than the Earth's around more than
one third of main sequence stars. It has been proposed that super-Earths are
scaled-up terrestrial planets that formed similarly, through mutual accretion
of planetary embryos, but in discs much denser than the solar protoplanetary
disc. We argue instead that terrestrial planets and super-Earths have two
distinct formation pathways that are regulated by the disc's pebble reservoir.
Through numerical integrations, which combine pebble accretion and N-body
gravity between embryos, we show that a difference of a factor of two in the
pebble mass-flux is enough to change the evolution from the terrestrial to the
super-Earth growth mode. If the pebble mass-flux is small, then the initial
embryos within the ice line grow slowly and do not migrate substantially,
resulting in a widely spaced population of Mars-mass embryos when the gas disc
dissipates. Without gas being present, the embryos become unstable and a small
number of terrestrial planets are formed by mutual collisions. The final
terrestrial planets are at most 5 Earth masses. Instead, if the pebble
mass-flux is high, then the initial embryos within the ice line rapidly become
sufficiently massive to migrate through the gas disc. Embryos concentrate at
the inner edge of the disc and growth accelerates through mutual merging. This
leads to the formation of a system of closely spaced super-Earths in the 5 to
20 Earth-mass range, bounded by the pebble isolation mass. Generally,
instabilities of these super-Earth systems after the disappearance of the gas
disc trigger additional merging events and dislodge the system from resonant
chains. The pebble flux - which controls the transition between the two growth
modes - may be regulated by the initial reservoir of solids in the disc or the
presence of more distant giant planets that can halt the radial flow of

observed in high resolution spectroscopic surveys can be explained by the
interplay of mixed populations, coming from the inner regions of the Milky Way
disc. The lower lithium content of these stars is a consequence of inside-out
disc formation, plus radial migration. In this framework, local stars with
super-solar metallicities would have migrated to the solar vicinity and
depleted their original lithium during their travel time. To arrive to such a
result, we took advantage of the AMBRE catalog of lithium abundances combined
with chemical evolution models which take into account the contribution to the
lithium enrichment by different nucleosynthetic sources. A large proportion of
migrated stars can explain the observed lower lithium abundance at super-solar
metallicities. We stress that nowadays, there is no stellar model able to
predict Li-depletion for such super-solar metallicity stars, and the Solar
Li-depletion has to be assumed. In addition, it currently exists no solid
quantitative estimate of the proportion of migrated stars in the Solar
neighborhood and their travel time. Our results illustrate how important it is

that super-Eddington accretion onto compact objects will power optically-thick
outflows and indicates an accretion rate 60-80 times the critical value. This
suggests that super-Eddington accretion onto magnetized systems can also power
massive winds. At super-Eddington levels, the iron line becomes more

atmospheric characterisation of a super-Earth. Here we analyse archival
$\textit{ROSAT}$ and $\textit{Swift}$ observations of $\pi$ Men in order to
determine the X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet irradiation of the planetary
atmosphere and assess whether atmospheric escape is likely to be on-going. We
find that $\pi$ Men has a similar level of X-ray emission to the Sun, with
$L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm bol} = (4.84^{+0.92}_{-0.84})\times10^{-7}$. However, due to
its small orbital separation, the high-energy irradiation of the super-Earth is
around 2000 times stronger than suffered by the Earth. We show that this is
sufficient to drive atmospheric escape at a rate greater than that readily
detected from the warm Neptune GJ 436b. Furthermore, we estimate $\pi$ Men to
be four times brighter at Ly $\alpha$ than GJ 436. Given the small atmospheric
scale heights of super-Earths, together with their potentially cloudy
atmospheres, and the consequent difficulty in measuring transmission spectra,
we conclude that ultraviolet absorption by material escaping $\pi$ Men c

In this work, we perform resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations in a classic

and analyze in detail the dynamic features of TSs and variations of the shock
strength in space and time. This research focuses on the fast reconnection
phase when plasmoids form and produce small-scale structures inside the flare

colliding with closed magnetic loops becomes super-magnetosonic, and
immediately becomes highly dynamical. The morphology of a TS can be flat,
oblique, or curved depending on the detailed interactions between the
outflows/plasmoids and the highly dynamic plasma in the looptop region. The TS
becomes weaker when a plasmoid is crossing through, or may even be destroyed by
well developed plasmoids and then re-constructed above the plasmoids. We also
perform detailed statistical analysis on important physical quantities along

Divergence problem, which is caused by the large margin between the

robust identity metric for faces from these two domains. Extensive experimental

  conductive boundary condition and applications",2018-11-05,Hongyu Liu,"This paper is concerned with the intrinsic geometric structures of conductive
transmission eigenfunctions. The geometric properties of interior transmission
eigenfunctions were first studied in [9]. It is shown in two scenarios that the
interior transmission eigenfunction must be locally vanishing near a corner of
the domain with an interior angle less than $\pi$. We significantly extend and
generalize those results in several aspects. First, we consider the conductive
transmission eigenfunctions which include the interior transmission
eigenfunctions as a special case. The geometric structures established for the
conductive transmission eigenfunctions in this paper include the results in [9]
as a special case. Second, the vanishing property of the conductive
transmission eigenfunctions is established for any corner as long as its
interior angle is not $\pi$ when the conductive transmission eigenfunctions
satisfy certain Herglotz functions approximation properties. That means, as
long as the corner singularity is not degenerate, the vanishing property holds
if the underlying conductive transmission eigenfunctions can be approximated by
a sequence of Herglotz functions under mild approximation rates. Third, the
regularity requirements on the interior transmission eigenfunctions in [9] are
significantly relaxed in the present study for the conductive transmission
eigenfunctions. Finally, as an interesting and practical application of the
obtained geometric results, we establish a unique recovery result for the
inverse problem associated with the transverse electromagnetic scattering by a

formation mode of supermassive black holes exceeding $10^9~M_\odot$ in the
early universe. We here investigate how such rapid accretion may occur with
finite amounts of heavy elements contained in the gas and dust. In our 1D
radiation-hydrodynamics simulations, the radiative transfer is solved for both
the direct UV lights emitted by an accretion disk and the diffuse IR lights
thermally emitted by dust grains. Our results show that the radiative force by
the IR lights causes a strong feedback to regulate the mass accretion. The
resulting mean accretion rate is lower with the higher metallicity, and there
is the critical metallicity $Z \sim 10^{-2}~Z_\odot$, above which the
super-Eddington accretion is prevented by the radiation pressure of the IR
lights. With this taken into account, we examine if the dusty super-Eddington
accretion occurs in young galaxies using a simple model. We show that a
sufficient number of galaxies at $z \gtrsim 10$ can be such potential sites if
BHs accrete the cold dense gas with $T \sim 10^2$ K, approximately the thermal
equilibrium value at $Z = 10^{-2}~Z_\odot$. We argue that the efficiency of the

success for image super-resolution (SR). However, most deep CNN based SR models
attempt to improve distortion measures (e.g. PSNR, SSIM, IFC, VIF) while
resulting in poor quantified perceptual quality (e.g. human opinion score,
no-reference quality measures such as NIQE). Few works have attempted to
improve the perceptual quality at the cost of performance reduction in
distortion measures. A very recent study has revealed that distortion and
perceptual quality are at odds with each other and there is always a trade-off
between the two. Often the restoration algorithms that are superior in terms of
perceptual quality, are inferior in terms of distortion measures. Our work
attempts to analyze the trade-off between distortion and perceptual quality for
the problem of single image SR. To this end, we use the well-known SR

be adapted to achieve better perceptual quality for a specific range of the

the error defined based on per-pixel accuracy alone, we train our network using
a generative adversarial network framework with EDSR as the generator module.
Our proposed network, called enhanced perceptual super-resolution network

systems based on single electron motion is an old challenge and an important
problem in condensed matter physics. In this paper we introduce a real space
approximation beyond super cell approximation for the study of these systems to
capture multi-site effects. Average disordered alloy or interacting system is
replaced by a self-energy, $\Sigma(i,j,E)$. We divided self-energy in q-space
$\Sigma({\bf q}; E)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{ij}e^{i{\bf q}.{\bf r}_{ij}}\Sigma(i,j;

revealed low amplitude features of water vapour compared to expectations from
cloud-free atmospheres of solar metallicity. The low spectral amplitudes in
such atmospheres could either be due to the presence of aerosols that obscure
part of the atmosphere or due to inherently low abundances of H$_2$O in the
atmospheres. A recent survey of transmission spectra of ten hot Jupiters used
empirical metrics to suggest atmospheres with a range of cloud/haze properties

Including these effects we find that lensing constraints are in $3.0\sigma$ or
$2.1\sigma$ tension between the SPT polarization measurements and Planck
temperature or lensing reconstruction constraints respectively. If the
lensing-induced covariance effects are neglected, the significance of these

from a given low-resolution version of it. Video Super Resolution (VSR) targets
series of given images, aiming to fuse them to create a higher resolution
outcome. Although SISR and VSR seem to have a lot in common, most SISR
algorithms do not have a simple and direct extension to VSR. VSR is considered
a more challenging inverse problem, mainly due to its reliance on a sub-pixel
accurate motion-estimation, which has no parallel in SISR. Another complication
is the dynamics of the video, often addressed by simply generating a single
frame instead of a complete output sequence.
  In this work we suggest a simple and robust super-resolution framework that
can be applied to single images and easily extended to video. Our work relies
on the observation that denoising of images and videos is well-managed and very
effectively treated by a variety of methods. We exploit the Plug-and-Play-Prior
framework and the Regularization-by-Denoising (RED) approach that extends it,
and show how to use such denoisers in order to handle the SISR and the VSR

the effectiveness and efficiency of existing image/video denoising algorithms,

  accretion",2018-10-02,Yasunori Hori,"The core-accretion model predicts that planetary cores as massive as
super-Earths undergo runaway gas accretion to become gas giants. However, the
exoplanet census revealed the prevalence of super-Earths close to their host
stars, which should have avoided runaway gas accretion. In fact, mass-radius
relationships of transiting planets suggest that some close-in super-Earths
possess H$_2$/He atmospheres of ~ 0.1-10% by mass. Previous studies indicated
that properties of a disk gas such as metallicity and the inflow/outflow cycle
of a disk gas around a super-Earth can regulate accumulation of a H$_2$/He
atmosphere onto itself. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism that radial
mass accretion in a disk can limit the gas accretion onto super-Earth cores.
Recent magneto-hydrodynamic simulations found that magnetically driven disk
winds can drive a rapid gas flow near the disk surface. Such a rapid gas flow
may slip out of a planetary core and regulate gas supply to an accreting gas
onto the core. We performed N-body simulations for formation of super-Earths
with accretion of atmospheres in a viscous accretion disk including effects of
wind-driven accretion. We found that even super-Earth cores can avoid
triggering runaway gas accretion if the inflow of a disk gas toward the cores
is limited by viscous accretion. Our model predicts that super-Earths having
H$_2$/He atmosphere of ~ 0.1-10 wt % form within $\lesssim$ 1 au of the central
star, whereas gas giants are born in the outer region. This mechanism can
explain the radial dependence of observed giant planets beyond the solar

improvement by utilizing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The
features in deep CNN contain different types of information which make
different contributions to image reconstruction. However, most CNN-based models
lack discriminative ability for different types of information and deal with
them equally, which results in the representational capacity of the models
being limited. On the other hand, as the depth of neural networks grows, the
long-term information coming from preceding layers is easy to be weaken or lost
in late layers, which is adverse to super-resolving image. To capture more
informative features and maintain long-term information for image
super-resolution, we propose a channel-wise and spatial feature modulation
(CSFM) network in which a sequence of feature-modulation memory (FMM) modules
is cascaded with a densely connected structure to transform low-resolution

multiplexing multiple views on a single image sensor. However, the high angular

field super-resolution is still at an early stage, the field of single image
super-resolution (SISR) has recently known significant advances with the use of
deep learning techniques. This paper describes a simple framework allowing us
to leverage state-of-the-art SISR techniques into light fields, while taking
into account specific light field geometrical constraints. The idea is to first
compute a representation compacting most of the light field energy into as few
components as possible. This is achieved by aligning the light field using
optical flows and then by decomposing the aligned light field using singular
value decomposition (SVD). The principal basis captures the information that is
coherent across all the views, while the other basis contain the high angular
frequencies. Super-resolving this principal basis using an SISR method allows
us to super-resolve all the information that is coherent across the entire
light field. This framework allows the proposed light field super-resolution
method to inherit the benefits of the SISR method used. Experimental results

budgets, models with wider features before ReLU activation have significantly
better performance for single image super-resolution (SISR). The resulted SR
residual network has a slim identity mapping pathway with wider (\(2\times\) to

widen activation (\(6\times\) to \(9\times\)) without computational overhead,
we introduce linear low-rank convolution into SR networks and achieve even
better accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. In addition, compared with batch
normalization or no normalization, we find training with weight normalization
leads to better accuracy for deep super-resolution networks. Our proposed SR
network \textit{WDSR} achieves better results on large-scale DIV2K image

http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08688v1,Deeply Supervised Depth Map Super-Resolution as Novel View Synthesis,2018-08-27,Xueying Qin,"Deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) has been successfully applied to
depth map super-resolution and outperforms existing methods by a wide margin.
However, there still exist two major issues with these DCNN based depth map
super-resolution methods that hinder the performance: i) The low-resolution
depth maps either need to be up-sampled before feeding into the network or
substantial deconvolution has to be used; and ii) The supervision
(high-resolution depth maps) is only applied at the end of the network, thus it
is difficult to handle large up-sampling factors, such as $\times 8, \times
16$. In this paper, we propose a new framework to tackle the above problems.
First, we propose to represent the task of depth map super-resolution as a
series of novel view synthesis sub-tasks. The novel view synthesis sub-task
aims at generating (synthesizing) a depth map from different camera pose, which
could be learned in parallel. Second, to handle large up-sampling factors, we
present a deeply supervised network structure to enforce strong supervision in
each stage of the network. Third, a multi-scale fusion strategy is proposed to
effectively exploit the feature maps at different scales and handle the
blocking effect. In this way, our proposed framework could deal with
challenging depth map super-resolution efficiently under large up-sampling
factors (e.g. $\times 8, \times 16$). Our method only uses the low-resolution
depth map as input, and the support of color image is not needed, which greatly
reduces the restriction of our method. Extensive experiments on various
benchmarking datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over current
state-of-the-art depth map super-resolution methods.",cs.CV,cat:quant-ph,all:super%20conducting

for information processing, it is imperative to maximise topological surface
state conduction, while simulateneously improving their quantum coherence.
However, these goals have turned out to be contradictory. Surface dominated
transport in topological insulators has been achieved primarily through
compensation doping of bulk carriers that introduces tremendous electronic
disorder and drastically deteriorates electronic coherence. In this work, we
use structural disorder instead of electronic disorder to manipulate electrical
properties of thin films of topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$. We achieve
decoupled surface state transport in our samples and observe significantly
suppressed carrier dephasing rates in the coupled surface state regime. As the
film thickness is decreased, the dephasing rate evolves from a linear to a
super-linear temperature dependence. While the former is consistent with
Nyquist electron-electron interactions, the latter leads to significantly
enhanced coherence at low temperatures and is indicative of energy exchange due
to frictional drag between the two surface states. Our work opens up the way to

simplicity, the SLIM disk solution is challenged by the latest generation of
three-dimensional radiation (magneto)-hydrodynamical simulations, in which
radiative losses can be an order of magnitude higher, and the mechanisms of
radiation transport is more complex than straight advection as it takes place

signals exported from super module are digitalized at TDC (Time to Digital

a tremendous pressure for data transmission in real time. In this paper, a
real-time data flow control method is designed. In this control method, data
flow is divided into 3 types: scientific data flow, status data flow and
control data flow. In scientific data flow, data of each TDC station is divided
into 4 sub-flows, and then is read out by a parallel and hierarchical network,
which consists of multiple readout mother boards and daughter boards groups. In
status data flow, status data is aggregated into a specific readout mother
board. Then it is uploaded to DAQ via readout daughter board. In control data
flow, control data is downloaded to all circuit modules in the opposite

surprising performance in two-dimensional (2D) images. Unfortunately, there are
few effective SR algorithms for three-dimensional (3D) images. In this paper,
we proposed a novel network named as three-dimensional super resolution
convolutional neural network (3DSRCNN) to realize voxel super resolution for CT

convergence of network training, insufficient memory, etc., we utilized
adjustable learning rate, residual-learning, gradient clipping, momentum
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) strategies to optimize training procedure. In
addition, we have explored the empirical guidelines to set appropriate number
of layers of network and how to use residual learning strategy. Additionally,
previous learning-based algorithms need to separately train for different scale
factors for reconstruction, yet our single model can complete the multi-scale

in the spin conductivity tensor. Typically, isotropic part of the spin
conductivity is larger than anisotropic one. The helical regime for the bulk
states, in which the electrons in the Fermi level have the same projection of
the spin on the direction of momentum, have been studied in a more detail. In
this regime, a substantial increase of the spin conductivity contribution from
the bulk states at the Fermi level is observed. We find that the bulk spin
conductivity is insensitive to disorder if Rashba spin-orbit coupling is larger
than disorder strength, otherwise, it is strongly suppressed. The contribution
to the spin conductivity from the surface states is almost independent of the
chemical potential, robust to disorder and its value is comparable to the spin

to their stars. As such, photoevaporation of their hydrogen envelopes etch
sharp features in an otherwise bland space spanned by planet radius and orbital
period. This, in turn, can be exploited to reveal the mass of these planets, in
addition to techniques such as radial velocity and transit-timing-variation.
Here, using updated radii for Kepler planet hosts from Gaia DR2, I show that
the photoevaporation features shift systematically to larger radius for planets
around more massive stars (ranging from M-dwarfs to F-dwarfs), corresponding to
a nearly linear scaling between planet mass and its host mass. By modelling
planet evolution under photo-evaporation, one further deduces that the masses
of super-Earths peak narrowly around $8 M_\oplus (M_*/M_\odot)$. Moreover, the
composition of their cores is likely terrestrial, and they were initially
coated with H/He envelopes a couple percent in mass. Interestingly, the masses
of these planets do not appear to depend on the metallicity values of their
host stars, while they may depend on the orbital separation weakly, possibly as
$r^{1/2}$. Taken together, the simplest interpretation of our results is that

essential to maintain a confined neighborhood for computing deep feature
correlation given degraded images. This is in contrast to existing practice

to 2 parsec. This detection allows us to do a detailed investigation of the
physical properties of the surroundings of the super massive black hole.
Further in, the cluster of high velocity stars orbiting the central super
massive black hole SgrA* represents an ideal probe for the gravitational
potential and the degree of relativity that one can attribute to this area.
Recently, three of the closest stars (S2, S38, and S55/S0-102) have been used

distance a relativistic parameter defined as ${\Upsilon}=r_s/r_p$ could be

is the pericenter distance of the orbiting star. Here, in this publication, we
highlight the robustness and significance of this result. If one aims at
investigating stronger relativistic effects one needs to get closer to SgrA*.
Here, one can use the emission of plasma blobs that orbit SgrA*. This

with super-penumbral field resulting hot multi-temperature plasma flows in the

Evershed flows in the chromosphere start from super penumbra towards sunspot
that end at the outer boundary of the penumbra. The hot plasma flow towards the
sunspot in the inverse Evershed channels show about 10 km s$^{-1}$ higher
velocity in H$\alpha$ wavelengths compared to the plasma emissions at various
temperatures as seen in different AIA filters. Even though these velocities are
about seven times higher than the typical inverse-Evershed flow speeds, the

suggests that the super-penumbral field lines that carry the inverse Evershed

into the sun and these two sets of field lines are completely distinct. The
discontinuity in the typical magnetic field and plasma properties at the

high-speed network which contains several distributed routers is a hard task.
Distributed sliding super point detection requires an algorithm that can
estimate the number of contacting hosts incrementally, scan packets faster than
their flowing speed and reconstruct sliding super point at the end of a time
period. But no existing algorithm satisfies these three requirements
simultaneously. To solve this problem, this paper firstly proposed a
distributed sliding super point detection algorithm running on GPU. The
advantage of this algorithm comes from a novel sliding estimator, which can
estimate contacting host number incrementally under a sliding window, and a set
of reversible hash functions, by which sliding super points could be regained
without storing additional data such as IP list. There are two main procedures
in this algorithm: packets scanning and sliding super points reconstruction.
Both could run parallel without any data reading conflict. When deployed on a
low cost GPU, this algorithm could deal with traffic with bandwidth as high as
680 Gb/s. A real world core network traffic is used to evaluate the performance
of this sliding super point detection algorithm on a cheap GPU, Nvidia GTX950

other hosts in a certain time period. The number of hosts contacting with a
super point is called as its cardinality. Cardinality estimating plays
important roles in network management and security. All of existing works focus
on how to estimate super point's cardinality under discrete time window. But
discrete time window causes great delay and the accuracy of estimating result
is subject to the starting of the window. sliding time window, moving
forwarding a small slice every time, offers a more accuracy and timely scale to
monitor super point's cardinality. On the other hand, super point's cardinality
estimating under sliding time window is more difficult because it requires an
algorithm to record the cardinality incrementally and report them immediately
at the end of the sliding duration. This paper firstly solves this problem by
devising a sliding time window available algorithm SRLA. SRLA records hosts
cardinality by a novel structure which could be updated incrementally. In order
to reduce the cardinality estimating time at the end of every sliding time

calculates the cardinality of hosts in the candidate list only. It also has the
ability to run parallel to deal with high speed network in line speed. This

(SYM) theory in two dimensions by means of lattice simulations. The theory
arises as dimensional reduction of $\mathcal{N}=1$ SYM theory in four

classical scalar potential has flat directions which may destabilize numerical
simulations. In addition, the fermion determinant need not be positive and this
sign-problem may cause further problems in a stochastic treatment. We
demonstrate that $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ super Yang-Mills theory has actually no
sign problem and that the flat directions are lifted and thus stabilized by
quantum corrections. Only the bare mass of the scalars experience a finite
additive renormalization in this finite theory. On various lattices with
different lattice constants we determine the scalar masses and hopping
parameters for which the supersymmetry violating terms are minimal. By studying
four Ward identities and by monitoring the $\pi$-mass we show that
supersymmetry is indeed restored in the continuum limit. In the second part we
calculate the masses of the low-lying bound states. We find that in the
infinite-volume and supersymmetric continuum limit the Veneziano-Yankielowicz

fluid, which depends on a variety of governing parameters such as the initial
density, $\Delta \rho$, the total initial height of the fluid, $H$, and the
slope of the terrain, $\alpha$, from where it is released. Depending on these
parameters, the gravity current may be designated as sub-critical, critical, or
super-critical. It is imperative to study the entrainment dynamics of a gravity
current in order to have a clear understanding of mixing transitions that
govern the flow physics, the shear layer thickness, $\delta_{u}$, and the
mixing layer thickness, $\delta_{\rho}$. Experiments were conducted in a
lock-exchange facility in which the dense fluid was separated from the ambient
lighter fluid using a gate. As the gate is released instantaneously, an energy
conserving gravity current is formed, for which the only governing parameter is
the Reynolds number defined as $Re=\frac{Uh}{\nu}$, where $U$ is the front
velocity of the gravity current, and $h$ is the height of the current. In our

super-hydrophobic spheres. The mutual interaction between the air layer
(plastron) encapsulating the super-hydrophobic spheres and the flow is
emphasised by studying the hydrodynamic performances. It is found that the air
plastron adapts its shape to the flow-induced stresses which compete with the
surface tension. This competition is characterised by introducing the Weber
number $\mathcal{W}e$, whilst the plastron deformation is estimated via the
aspect ratio $\chi$. While noticeable distortions are locally observed, the
plastron becomes more and more spherical in average (i.e. $\chi \rightarrow 1$)
as far as $\mathcal{W}e$ increases. In comparison to the reference spheres,
high deformation of the air plastron plastron (oblate shape) leads to lift and
drag increase, whereas low deformation (spherical shape) yields lift and drag
mitigation. Accordingly, taking into account the plastron deformation provides
an attractive way to explain the somehow discordant results reported in other
studies at comparable Reynolds numbers. If confirmed by additional studies, our
findings would imply that plastron compliance and its feedback on the flow,

instability is solely determined by the Hall effect and is independent of the

right circularly polarized whistler becomes unstable in the super Alfvenic
flows whereas low frequency, left circularly polarized ion-cyclotron wave
becomes unstable in the presence of sub Alfvenic shear flows. The growth rate
of the Kelvin Helmholtz instability in the super Alfvenic case is higher than
the corresponding ideal magnetohydrodynamic rate. In the sub Alfvenic case, the
Hall effect opens up a new, hitherto inaccessible (to the magnetohydrodynamics)
channel through which the partially or fully ionized fluid can become
Kelvin-Helmholtz unstable. The instability growth rate in this case is smaller
than the super Alfvenic case owing to the smaller free shear energy content of
the flow. When the Hall term is somewhat smaller than the advection term in the
induction equation, the Hall effect is also responsible for the appearance of a
new overstable mode whose growth rate is smaller than the purely growing Kelvin
Helmholtz mode. On the other hand, when the Hall diffusion dominates the
advection term, the growth rate of the instability depends only on the Alfven

the Sun, appear to inhabit the centers of all massive galaxies.
Cosmologically-motivated theories of galaxy formation need feedback from these
super-massive black holes to regulate star formation. In the absence of such
feedback, state-of-the-art numerical simulations dramatically fail to reproduce
the number density and properties of massive galaxies in the local Universe.
However, there is no observational evidence of this strongly coupled
co-evolution between super-massive black holes and star formation, impeding our
understanding of baryonic processes within galaxies. Here we show that the star
formation histories (SFHs) of nearby massive galaxies, as measured from their
integrated optical spectra, depend on the mass of the central super-massive
black hole. Our results suggest that black hole mass growth scales with gas
cooling rate in the early Universe. The subsequent quenching of star formation
takes place earlier and more efficiently in galaxies hosting more massive
central black holes. The observed relation between black hole mass and star
formation efficiency applies to all generations of stars formed throughout a

infrastructure provisioning, public transportation, events planning, and other
domains. Monitoring city-wide mobile traffic is however a complex and costly
process that relies on dedicated probes. Some of these probes have limited
precision or coverage, others gather tens of gigabytes of logs daily, which
independently offer limited insights. Extracting fine-grained patterns involves
expensive spatial aggregation of measurements, storage, and post-processing. In
this paper, we propose a mobile traffic super-resolution technique that
overcomes these problems by inferring narrowly localised traffic consumption
from coarse measurements. We draw inspiration from image processing and design
a deep-learning architecture tailored to mobile networking, which combines
Zipper Network (ZipNet) and Generative Adversarial neural Network (GAN) models.
This enables to uniquely capture spatio-temporal relations between traffic
volume snapshots routinely monitored over broad coverage areas
(`low-resolution') and the corresponding consumption at 0.05 km $^2$ level
(`high-resolution') usually obtained after intensive computation. Experiments
we conduct with a real-world data set demonstrate that the proposed
ZipNet(-GAN) infers traffic consumption with remarkable accuracy and up to
100$\times$ higher granularity as compared to standard probing, while
outperforming existing data interpolation techniques. To our knowledge, this is

brings about a puzzle for the core-accretion scenario. Since observed
super-Earths are in the range of critical mass, they would accrete gas
efficiently and become gas giants. Theoretically, super-Earths are predicted to
be rare in the core-accretion framework. To resolve this contradiction, we
propose that the tidally-forced turbulent diffusion may affect the heat
transport inside the planet. Thermal feedback induced by turbulent diffusion is
investigated. We find that the tidally-forced turbulence would generate
pseudo-adiabatic regions within radiative zones, which pushes the
radiative-convective boundaries (RCBs) inwards. This would decrease the cooling
luminosity and enhance the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) timescale. For a given
lifetime of protoplanetary disks (PPDs), there exists a critical threshold for
the turbulent diffusivity, $\nu_{\rm critical}$. If $\nu_{\rm turb}>\nu_{\rm
critical} $, the KH timescale is longer than the disk lifetime and the planet
would become a super-Earth rather than a gas giant. We find that even a small
value of turbulent diffusion has influential effects on evolutions of
super-Earths. $\nu_{\rm critical}$ increases with the core mass. We further
ascertain that, within the minimum mass extrasolar nebula (MMEN), $\nu_{\rm
critical}$ increases with the semi-major axis. This may explain the feature
that super-Earths are common in inner PPD regions, while gas giants are common
in the outer PPD regions. The predicted envelope mass fraction (EMF) is not
fully consistent with observations. We discuss physical processes, such as late
core assembly and mass loss mechanisms, that may be operating during

  Conductances Using Somatic Clamp",2017-10-14,David Cai,"The interaction between excitation and inhibition is crucial for brain
computation. To understand synaptic mechanisms underlying brain function, it is
important to separate excitatory and inhibitory inputs to a target neuron. In
the traditional method, after applying somatic current or voltage clamp, the
excitatory and inhibitory conductances are determined from the synaptic
current-voltage (I-V) relation --- the slope corresponds to the total
conductance and the intercept corresponds to the reversal current. Because of
the space clamp effect, the measured conductance in general deviates
substantially from the local conductance on the dendrite. Therefore, the
interpretation of the conductance measured by the traditional method remains to
be clarified. In this work, based on the investigation of an idealized
ball-and-stick neuron model and a biologically realistic pyramidal neuron
model, we first demonstrate both analytically and numerically that the
conductance determined by the traditional method has no clear biological
interpretation due to the neglect of a nonlinear interaction between the clamp
current and the synaptic current across the spatial dendrites. As a
consequence, the traditional method can induce an arbitrarily large error of
conductance measurement, sometimes even leads to unphysically negative
conductance. To circumvent the difficulty of elucidating synaptic impact on
neuronal computation using the traditional method, we then propose a framework
to determine the effective conductance that reflects directly the functional
impact of synaptic inputs on action potential initiation and thereby neuronal
information processing. Our framework has been further verified in realistic
neuron simulations, thus greatly improves upon the traditional approach by
providing a reliable and accurate assessment of the role of synaptic activity

modest gas masses are accreted from short-lived and gas-poor nebulae

atmospheres born in such environments can be optically thin to both incident

for global analysis of extremely extended cosmic-ray phenomena, so-called
super-preshowers, beyond the capabilities of existing, discrete, detectors and
observatories. To date cosmic-ray research has been focused on detecting single
air showers, while the search for ensembles of cosmic-ray events induced by
super-preshowers is a scientific terra incognita - CREDO explores this
uncharted realm. Positive detection of super-preshowers would have an impact on
ultra-high energy astrophysics, cosmology and the physics of fundamental
particle interactions as they can theoretically be formed within both classical
(photon-photon interactions) and exotic (Super Heavy Dark Matter particle decay
and interaction) scenarios. Some super-preshowers are predicted to have a
significant spatial extent - a unique signature only detectable with the
existing cosmic-ray infrastructure taken as a global network. An obvious,
although yet unprobed, super-preshower 'detection limit' would be located
somewhere between an air shower, induced by a super-preshower composed of
tightly collimated particles, and a super-preshower composed of particles
spread so widely that only few of them can reach the Earth. CREDO will probe
this detection limit, leading to either an observation of an as yet unseen
physical phenomenon, or the setting upper limits to the existence of large
extraterrestrial cascades which would constrain fundamental physics models.
While CREDO's focus is on testing physics at energies close to the Grand

precisely, it develops a theoretical analysis of support recovery for the
so-called BLASSO method, which is an off-the-grid generalisation of l1
regularization (also known as the LASSO). While super-resolution is of
paramount importance in overcoming the limitations of many imaging devices, its
theoretical analysis is still lacking beyond the 1-dimensional (1-D) case. The
reason is that in the 2-dimensional (2-D) case and beyond, the relative
position of the spikes enters the picture, and different geometrical
configurations lead to different stability properties. Our first main
contribution is a connection, in the limit where the spikes cluster at a given
point, between solutions of the dual of the BLASSO problem and Hermite
polynomial interpolation ideals. Polynomial bases for these ideals, introduced
by De Boor, can be computed by Gaussian elimination, and lead to an algorithmic
description of limiting solutions to the dual problem. With this construction
at hand, our second main contribution is a detailed analysis of the support
stability and super-resolution effect in the case of a pair of spikes. This
includes in particular a sharp analysis of how the signal-to-noise ratio should
scale with respect to the separation distance between the spikes. Lastly,
numerical simulations on different classes of kernels show the applicability of

large learning rates regularize the training, hence requiring a reduction of

  Assessment of the magnetospheric rebound model for planet formation scenarios",2017-08-03,Chris W. Ormel,"Context.The Kepler mission has provided a large sample to statistically
analyze the orbital properties of the super-Earth planets. We hypothesize that
these planets formed early and consider the problem of matching planet
formation theory to the current observations. Two scenarios, disk migration and
in-situ formation, have been proposed to explain their origin. In the migration
scenario planets migrate inward due to planet-disk interaction, whereas in the
in-situ scenario planets assemble locally. Therefore, planets formed by
migration are expected to end up in resonances, whereas those formed in-situ
are expected to stay in short period ratios and in non-resonant orbits. Both
predictions are at odds with observations. Aims. We investigate whether a
preferred formation scenario can be identified through a comparison between the
magnetospheric rebound model and the Kepler data. Methods. We conduct N-body
simulations of two-planet systems during the disk dispersal phase, and make a
statistical comparison between the simulations and the Kepler observations.
Results. Comparing the two scenarios, we find that magnetospheric rebound tends
to erase the difference in the orbital configuration that was initially
presented. After disk dispersal, not all planets are in resonance in the
migration scenario, whereas planets do not remain in compact configurations in
the in-situ scenario. In both scenarios, the orbits of planets increase with
the cavity expansion, and their period ratios have a wider distribution.
Conclusions. From a statistical perspective, the magnetospheric rebound model
reproduces several observed properties of Kepler planets, such as the
significant number of planets are not in resonances and planet pairs can end up
at large period ratios. The disparity in orbital configuration between the two
formation scenarios is substantially reduced after disk dispersal.",astro-ph.EP,cat:quant-ph,all:super%20conducting

about 10 % of their total mass budget. Such planets are present in the Solar
System (Uranus, Neptune) and are frequently observed in short periods around
other stars (the so-called Super-Earths). In contrast to these observations,
theoretical calculations based on the evolution of hydrostatic envelopes argue
that such low mass envelopes cannot be maintained around cores exceeding five
Earth masses. Instead, under nominal disc conditions, these planets would
acquire massive envelopes through runaway gas accretion within the lifetime of
the protoplanetary disc. In this work, we show that planetary envelopes are not
in hydrostatic balance, which slows down envelope growth. A series of
3-dimensional, global, radiative hydrodynamical simulations reveal a steady
state gas flow, which enters through the poles and exits in the disc midplane.
Gas is pushed through the outer envelope in about 10 orbital timescales. In
regions of the disc that are not significantly dust-depleted, envelope
accretion onto cores of about five Earth masses can get stalled as the gas flow
enters the deep interior. Accreted solids sublimate deep in the convective
interior, but small opacity-providing grains are trapped in the flow and do not
settle, which further prevents rapid envelope accretion. The transition to
runaway gas accretion can however be reached when cores grow larger than
typical Super-Earths, beyond 15 Earth masses, and preferably when disc
opacities are below kappa=1 cm^2/g. These findings offer an explanation for the

the physics of diffraction, which acts as a low-pass filter. The information on
sub-wavelength features is carried by evanescent waves, never reaching the
camera, thereby posing a hard limit on resolution: the so-called diffraction
limit. Modern microscopic methods enable super-resolution, by employing
florescence techniques. State-of-the-art localization based fluorescence
subwavelength imaging techniques such as PALM and STORM achieve sub-diffraction
spatial resolution of several tens of nano-meters. However, they require tens
of thousands of exposures, which limits their temporal resolution. We have
recently proposed SPARCOM (sparsity based super-resolution correlation
microscopy), which exploits the sparse nature of the fluorophores distribution,
alongside a statistical prior of uncorrelated emissions, and showed that
SPARCOM achieves spatial resolution comparable to PALM/STORM, while capturing
the data hundreds of times faster. Here, we provide a detailed mathematical
formulation of SPARCOM, which in turn leads to an efficient numerical
implementation, suitable for large-scale problems. We further extend our method

represents a challenge for planet formation theory: how did they avoid runaway
gas accretion and collapsing to hot Jupiters despite their core masses being in
the critical range of $M_\mathrm{c} \simeq 10 M_\mathrm{\oplus}$? Previous
three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulations indicate that atmospheres of
low-mass planets cannot be considered isolated from the protoplanetary disc,
contrary to what is assumed in 1D-evolutionary calculations. This finding is
referred to as the recycling hypothesis. In this Paper we investigate the
recycling hypothesis for super-Earth planets, accounting for realistic 3D
radiation hydrodynamics. Also, we conduct a direct comparison in terms of the
evolution of the entropy between 1D and 3D geometries. We clearly see that 3D
atmospheres maintain higher entropy: although gas in the atmosphere loses
entropy through radiative cooling, the advection of high entropy gas from the
disc into the Bondi/Hill sphere slows down Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction,
potentially arresting envelope growth at a sub-critical gas mass fraction.
Recycling, therefore, operates vigorously, in line with results by previous
studies. However, we also identify an ""inner core"" -- in size $\approx$ 25% of
the Bondi radius -- where streamlines are more circular and entropies are much
lower than in the outer atmosphere. Future studies at higher resolutions are

  error-free unwrapping and signal-to-noise ratio",2017-06-08,Guillermo Garnica,"From 1971 to 2012 dual-wavelength optical-metrology used only the demodulated
low-sensitivity phase-difference of two close-sensitive fringes.
Dual-wavelength phase-metrology that additionally uses the phase-sum was first
reported by Di et al. in 2013 [28]; this was an important step to increase the
phase-accuracy in optical metrology. This and its derived papers however do not
offer mathematical analysis for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the
phase-difference and phase-sum. Neither provide the mathematical analysis for
unwrapping the phase-sum without errors. Here a general theory for
super-sensitive two-wavelength phase-metrology is given. In particular
mathematical analysis and formulas for SNR and error-free phase-unwrapping for
two-wavelength metrology is provided. We start by phase-demodulating two
close-sensitivity fringes by phase-shifting algorithms (PSAs). We then
calculate their phase-difference and their phase-sum; the phase-difference is
assumed non-wrapped. However the phase-sum is highly wrapped, super-sensitive
and has much higher SNR. Spatial phase unwrapping for a highly discontinuous
phase-sum is precluded. However as we show, it is possible to unwrap the noisy
phase-sum from the noisier phase-difference without errors. We apply this
super-sensitive phase-metrology theory to profilometry allowing us to obtain
super-sensitive height measurements. To the best of our knowledge the
mathematical analysis and formulas herein presented for the SNR and error-free

resistance) of metal contacts to thermal management of graphene devices, prior
reported thermal conductance of metal/graphene interfaces are all relatively
low, only 20-40 MW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$. One possible route to improve the thermal
conductance ($G$) of metal/graphene interfaces is through additional heat
conduction by electrons, since graphene can be easily doped by metals. In this
paper, we evaluate the electronic heat conduction across metal/graphene
interfaces by measuring the thermal conductance of Pd/transferred graphene
(trG)/Pd interfaces, prepared by either thermal evaporation or radio-frequency
(rf) magnetron sputtering, over a wide temperature range of 80 to 500 K. We
find that for the samples prepared by thermal evaporation, the thermal
conductance of Pd/trG/Pd is 42 MW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$. The thermal conductance
only weakly depends on temperature, which suggests that heat is predominantly
carried by phonons across the intrinsic Pd/graphene interface. However, for
Pd/trG/Pd samples with the top Pd films deposited by rf magnetron sputtering,
we observe a significant increment of thermal conductance from the intrinsic
value of 42 MW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ to 300 MW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$, and $G$ is
roughly proportional to $T$. We attribute the enhancement of thermal
conductance to an additional channel of heat transport by electrons via
atomic-scale pinholes formed in the graphene during the sputtering process. We
thus conclude that electrons play a negligible role in heat conduction across
intrinsic interfaces of metal and pristine graphene, and the contribution of
electrons is only substantial if graphene is damaged.",cond-mat.mes-hall,cat:quant-ph,all:super%20conducting

break this visible-wavelength barrier we use the phase-information provided by
four or more interferograms in the visible range. Having the four demodulated
phases we calculate a phase-difference and the sum of the four phases which is
the FUV-equivalent super-resolution phase. The phase-difference is in the
infrared phase-sensitivity range and it is assumed non-wrapped. On the other
hand the phase-sum is in the FUV phase-sensitivity range and it is
highly-wrapped. As shown herein it is possible to unwrap the phase-sum in the
temporal domain using the phase-difference and our previously reported
extended-range 2-step temporal phase-unwrapper. Of course higher than FUV
equivalent phase-sensitivity interferometry may be obtained by increasing the
number of independent estimated phases from visible-wavelength interferograms.
As far as we know, this FUV equivalent-wavelength super-resolution

narrow (hyper-spectral) wave-length bands. Just like the spatial statistics of

high-frequency content from a low resolution image, the same is also true in
the spectral domain: the materials and lighting conditions of the observed
world induce structure in the spectrum of wavelengths observed at a given

diagnosis and achieve blind spectral super-resolution from single images. We
start from the conjecture that, just like in the spatial domain, we can learn
the statistics of natural image spectra, and with its help generate finely
resolved hyper-spectral images from RGB input. Technically, we follow the

high-level vision problems and enjoys several merits. This paper aims to extend
the merits of residual network, such as skip connection induced fast training,
for a typical low-level vision problem, i.e., single image super-resolution. In
general, the two main challenges of existing deep CNN for supper-resolution lie
in the gradient exploding/vanishing problem and large numbers of parameters or
computational cost as CNN goes deeper. Correspondingly, the skip connections or
identity mapping shortcuts are utilized to avoid gradient exploding/vanishing

activation which led to better performance. To tackle with the second problem,
a lightweight CNN architecture which has carefully designed width, depth and

Lemvig \cite{JL}, this article generalizes latest results on reproducing
formulas for generalized translation invariant (GTI) systems to the setting of
super-spaces over a second countable locally compact abelian (LCA) group $G$.
To do so, we introduce the notion of a super-GTI system with finite sequences
as generators from a super-space $L^2(G) \oplus \cdots \oplus L^2(G) $ ($N$
summands). We characterize the generators of two super-GTI systems in the

give necessary and sufficient conditions for two Bessel families to be
orthogonal frames (we call as GTI-orthogonal frame systems) when the Bessel
families have the form of GTI systems in $L^2(G)$. As a consequence, we deduce
similar results for several function systems including the case of TI systems,
and GTI systems on compact abelian groups. As an application, we apply our
duality result for super-GTI systems to the Bessel families with a wave-packet
structure (combination of wavelet as well as Gabor structure), and hence a
characterization for dual super wave-packet systems on LCA groups is obtained.
In addition, we relate the well established theory from literature with our

flow in a fluid layer heated from below and cooled from above, were conducted
to investigate the effect of mixed insulating and conducting boundary
conditions on convective flows. Rayleigh numbers between $\text{Ra}=10^7$ and
$\text{Ra}=10^9$ were considered, for Prandtl numbers $\text{Pr}=1$ and
$\text{Pr}=10$. The bottom plate was divided into patterns of conducting and
insulating stripes. The size ratio between these stripes was fixed to unity and
the total number of stripes was varied. Global quantities such as the heat
transport and average bulk temperature and local quantities such as the
temperature just below the insulating boundary wall were investigated. For the
case with the top boundary divided into two halves, one conducting and one
insulating, the heat transfer was found to be approximately two thirds of the
fully conducting case. Increasing the pattern frequency increased the heat
transfer which asymptotically approached the fully conducting case, even if
only half of the surface is conducting. Fourier analysis of the temperature
field revealed that the imprinted pattern of the plates is diffused in the
thermal boundary layers, and cannot be detected in the bulk. With
conducting-insulating patterns on both plates, the trends previously described
were similar, however, the half-and-half division led to a heat transfer of
about a half of the fully conducting case instead of two-thirds. The effect of
the ratio of conducting and insulating areas was also analyzed, and it was
found that even for systems with a top plate with only $25\%$ conducting

planets survive migration, and (2) articulating the process by which
protoplanetary disks disperse---and in particular how they accrete onto their

gas surrounding planets has no intrinsic diffusivity (""viscosity""). In
inviscid, laminar disks, a planet readily repels gas away from its orbit. On
short timescales, zero viscosity gas accumulates inside a planet's orbit to
slow Type I migration by orders of magnitude. On longer timescales, multiple
super-Earths (distributed between, say, $\sim$0.1--10 AU) can torque inviscid
gas out of interplanetary space, either inward to feed their stars, or outward
to be blown away in a wind. We explore this picture with 2D hydrodynamics
simulations of Earths and super-Earths embedded in inviscid disks, confirming
their slow/stalled migration even under gas-rich conditions, and showing that
disk transport rates range up to $\sim$$10^{-7} M_\odot~{\rm yr^{-1}}$ and
scale as $\dot{M} \propto \Sigma M_{\rm p}^{3/2}$, where $\Sigma$ is the disk
surface density and $M_{\rm p}$ is the planet mass. Gas initially sandwiched
between two planets is torqued past both into the inner and outer disks. In
sum, sufficiently compact systems of super-Earths can clear their natal disk

conducting channel, the electrochemical capacitance follows a symmetric
Gaussian distribution at weak disorders as expected from the random matrix

constraints on planetary formation and migration. Studies have shown that giant
planets that migrate through the protoplanetary disk can accrete substantial
amounts of oxygen-rich planetesimals, leading to super-solar metallicities in
the envelope and solar or sub-solar C/O ratios. Pebble accretion has been
demonstrated to play an important role in core accretion and to have growth
rates that are consistent with planetary migration. The high pebble accretion
rates allow planetary cores to start their growth beyond 10 AU and subsequently
migrate to cold (>~ 1 AU), warm (~0.1 AU- 1AU) or hot (<~ 0.1 AU) orbits. In
this work we investigate how the formation of giant planets via pebble
accretion influences their atmospheric chemical compositions. We find that
under the standard pebble accretion scenario, where the core is isolated from
the envelope, the resulting metallicities (O/H and C/H ratios) are sub-solar,
while the C/O ratios are super-solar. Planets that migrate through the disk to
become hot Jupiters accrete substantial amounts of water vapour, but still
acquire slightly sub-solar O/H and super-solar C/O of 0.7-0.8. The metallicity
can be substantially sub-solar (~0.2-0.5x solar) and the C/O can even approach

  with Multi-Resolution CNNs",2016-10-04,Yu Qiao,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have made remarkable progress on scene
recognition, partially due to these recent large-scale scene datasets, such as
the Places and Places2. Scene categories are often defined by multi-level
information, including local objects, global layout, and background
environment, thus leading to large intra-class variations. In addition, with
the increasing number of scene categories, label ambiguity has become another
crucial issue in large-scale classification. This paper focuses on large-scale
scene recognition and makes two major contributions to tackle these issues.
First, we propose a multi-resolution CNN architecture that captures visual
content and structure at multiple levels. The multi-resolution CNNs are
composed of coarse resolution CNNs and fine resolution CNNs, which are
complementary to each other. Second, we design two knowledge guided
disambiguation techniques to deal with the problem of label ambiguity. (i) We
exploit the knowledge from the confusion matrix computed on validation data to
merge ambiguous classes into a super category. (ii) We utilize the knowledge of
extra networks to produce a soft label for each image. Then the super
categories or soft labels are employed to guide CNN training on the Places2. We
conduct extensive experiments on three large-scale image datasets (ImageNet,
Places, and Places2), demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

then using the coefficients of this representation to generate the

existing sparse representation methods for super resolution focus on the
luminance channel information and do not capture interactions between color
channels. In this work, we extend sparsity based super-resolution to multiple
color channels by taking color information into account. Edge similarities
amongst RGB color bands are exploited as cross channel correlation constraints.
These additional constraints lead to a new optimization problem which is not
easily solvable; however, a tractable solution is proposed to solve it
efficiently. Moreover, to fully exploit the complementary information among
color channels, a dictionary learning method is also proposed specifically to
learn color dictionaries that encourage edge similarities. Merits of the

failed to grow fast enough to become the cores of gas giants before the natal
protostellar disk dispersed. We model the failed cores' inward orbital
migration in the low-mass or type I regime, to stopping points at distances
where the tidal interaction with the protostellar disk applies zero net torque.
The three kinds of migration traps considered are those due to the dead zone's
outer edge, the ice line, and the transition from accretion to starlight as the
disk's main heat source. As the disk disperses, the traps move toward final
positions near or just outside 1~au. Planets at this location exceeding about
3~M$_\oplus$ open a gap, decouple from their host trap, and migrate inward in
the high-mass or type II regime to reach the vicinity of the star. We
synthesize the population of planets formed in this scenario, finding that some
fraction of the observed super-Earths can be failed cores. Most super-Earths
formed this way have more than 4~M$_\oplus$, so their orbits when the disk
disperses are governed by type II migration. These planets have solid cores
surrounded by gaseous envelopes. Their subsequent photoevaporative mass loss is
most effective for masses originally below about 6 M$_\oplus$. The failed core

super-resolution using faster and deeper convolutional neural networks, one
central problem remains largely unsolved: how do we recover the finer texture
details when we super-resolve at large upscaling factors? The behavior of
optimization-based super-resolution methods is principally driven by the choice
of the objective function. Recent work has largely focused on minimizing the
mean squared reconstruction error. The resulting estimates have high peak
signal-to-noise ratios, but they are often lacking high-frequency details and
are perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they fail to match the fidelity
expected at the higher resolution. In this paper, we present SRGAN, a
generative adversarial network (GAN) for image super-resolution (SR). To our
knowledge, it is the first framework capable of inferring photo-realistic
natural images for 4x upscaling factors. To achieve this, we propose a
perceptual loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a content
loss. The adversarial loss pushes our solution to the natural image manifold
using a discriminator network that is trained to differentiate between the
super-resolved images and original photo-realistic images. In addition, we use
a content loss motivated by perceptual similarity instead of similarity in
pixel space. Our deep residual network is able to recover photo-realistic
textures from heavily downsampled images on public benchmarks. An extensive

coupled to a helical edge of a two-dimensional topological insulator. When the
system is symmetric with respect to in-plane spin rotation, the noise is
dominated by the Nyquist component even in the presence of a voltage bias $V$.
The corresponding noise spectrum $S(V,\omega)$ is determined by a modified
fluctuation-dissipation theorem with the differential conductance $G(V,\omega)$
in place of the linear one. The differential noise $\partial S/ \partial V$,
commonly measured in experiments, is strongly dependent on frequency on a small
scale $\tau_{K}^{-1}\ll T$ set by the Korringa relaxation rate of the local
moment. This is in stark contrast with the case of conventional mesoscopic
conductors where $\partial S/ \partial V$ is frequency-independent and defined
by the shot noise. In a helical edge, a violation of the spin-rotation symmetry
leads to the shot noise, which becomes important only at a high bias.

Currently, cryogenic refrigerators with $^3$He gas are widely used for cooling

to the current world-wide shortage. Therefore, it is important to consider
alternative methods of refrigeration. Here, we show that a new type of

adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration, which does not require 3He gas. A

accurately estimated directly from imaging data using a Laplace approximation

of changes in molecular motion patterns. Most importantly, the accuracy of

study of its electronic thermal conductivity is still missing. Here, we first
characterize the electron-phonon intrinsic contribution to the electronic
thermal resistivity of graphene as a function of doping using electronic and
phonon dispersions and electron-phonon couplings calculated from first
principles at the level of density-functional theory and many-body perturbation
theory (GW). Then, we include extrinsic electron-impurity scattering using
low-temperature experimental estimates. Under these conditions, we find that
the in-plane electronic thermal conductivity of doped graphene is ~300 W/mK at
room temperature, independently of doping. This result is much larger than
expected, and comparable to the total thermal conductivity of typical metals,
contributing ~10 % to the total thermal conductivity of bulk graphene. Notably,
in samples whose physical or domain sizes are of the order of few micrometers
or smaller, the relative contribution coming from the electronic thermal
conductivity is more important than in the bulk limit, since lattice thermal
conductivity is much more sensitive to sample or grain size at these scales.

a rich diversity of compositions as inferred through their mean densities. Here
we present a model that combines equilibrium chemistry in evolving disks with
core accretion that tracks materials accreted onto planets during their
formation. In doing so, we aim to explain why super Earths form so frequently
and how they acquire such a diverse range of compositions. A key feature of our
model is disk inhomogeneities, or planet traps, that act as barriers to rapid
type-I migration. The traps we include are the dead zone, which can be caused
by either cosmic ray or X-ray ionization, the ice line, and the heat
transition. We find that in disks with sufficiently long lifetimes ($\gtrsim$ 4

heat transition and X-ray dead zone produces hot Jupiters while the ice line
and cosmic ray dead zones produce Jupiters at roughly 1 AU. Super Earth
formation takes place within short-lived disks ($\lesssim$ 2 Myr), whereby the
disks are photoevaporated while planets are in a slow phase of gas accretion.
We find that super Earth compositions range from dry and rocky ($<$ 6 % ice by

like the collisional and Hall conductivities of the $\alpha$-T$_3$ model. The
collisional conductivity exhibits a series of peaks at strong magnetic field.
Each of the conductivity peaks for $\alpha=0$ (graphene) splits into two in
presence of a finite $\alpha$. This splitting occurs due to a finite phase
difference between the contributions coming from the two valleys. The density
of states is also calculated to explore the origin of the splitting of
conductivity peaks. As $\alpha$ approaches $1$, the right split part of the
conductivity peak comes closer to the left split part of the next conductivity
peak. At $\alpha=1$, they merge with each other to produce a new series of the
conductivity peaks. On the other hand, the Hall conductivity undergoes a smooth
transition from $\sigma_{yx}=2(2n+1)e^2/h$ to $\sigma_{yx}=4ne^2/h$ with

of graphene, which leads to a dramatic decrease in thermal conductivity (from
3590 to 1328 W/mK - a 63% reduction), HPG shows a notable increase in thermal
conductivity (615 W/mK), which is 76% higher than that of PG (350 W/mK). The

hydrogenation, despite the increase in the phonon scattering phase space. The

find that even though the shortest distances between the nearest-neighboring Fe
atoms in these three compounds already exceed 6 \AA, much larger than the bond
length of a chemical bonding, they all remarkably show antiferromagnetic (AFM)
coupling along $b$ axis with very weak spin-spin correlation along $a$ axis.
Our study shows that the mechanism underlying this novel AFM coupling is such a
new type of exchange interaction between the nearest-neighboring Fe-based
super-moments mediated by Ba cations, which we call the super-super exchange
interaction, in which each magnetic Fe atom partially polarizes its four
nearest-neighboring $X$ atoms to form a super-moment through $p$-$d$ orbital
hybridization and the $X$ atoms in neighboring Fe$X_4$ tetrahedra along $b$
axis antiferromagnetically couple with each others through the intermediate Ba
cations. Different from the conventional superexchange, here it is cations
rather than anions that mediate two neighboring super-moments. According to the
calculated strength of the AFM coupling, we predict that among these compounds
the highest AFM phase transition temperature $T_N$ may reach 110 K in
Ba$_3$(FeSe$_4$)Br, in comparison with the observed $T_N$s of 84 K in
Ba$_3$(FeS$_4$)Br and 95 K in Ba$_3$(FeS$_4$)Cl.",cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cat:quant-ph,all:super%20conducting

affects the formation locations for the observed close-in super-Earths in
exosolar systems. We find that a protoplanetary disk that includes a dead zone
(a region of low turbulence) has substantially more material in the inner parts
of the disk, possibly allowing for in situ formation. For the dead zone to last
the entire lifetime of the disk requires the active layer surface density to be
sufficiently small, <100 g/cm^2. Migration through a dead zone may be very slow
and thus super-Earth formation followed by migration towards the star through
the dead zone is less likely. For fully turbulent disks, there is not enough
material for in situ formation. However, in this case, super-Earths can form
farther out in the disk and migrate inwards on a reasonable timescale. We
suggest that both of these formation mechanisms operate in different planetary
systems. This can help to explain the observed large range in densities of
super-Earths because the formation location determines the composition.
Furthermore, we speculate that super-Earths could have formed in the inner
parts of our solar system and cleared the material in the region inside of
Mercury's orbit. The super-Earths could migrate through the gas disk and fall
into the Sun if the disk was sufficiently cool during the final gas disk
accretion process. While it is definitely possible to meet all of these

dynamically important. When the magnetic field is present, the thermal
conduction is anisotropic and energy transport is along magnetic field lines.
In this paper, we study the effects of anisotropic thermal conduction on the
wind production in hot accretion flows by performing two-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We find that thermal conduction has only
moderate effects on the mass flux of wind. But the energy flux of wind can be
increased by a factor of $\sim 10$ due to the increase of wind velocity when
thermal conduction is included. The increase of wind velocity is because of the
increase of driving forces (e.g. gas pressure gradient force and centrifugal
force) when thermal conduction is included. This result demonstrates that
thermal conduction plays an important role in determining the properties of

assumption of orthodox quantum mechanics necessitates only the following

additional metaphysical speculation, such as to whether quantum indeterminism,
i.e., intrinsic randomness, implicates the reality of experimenter ""freedom"",
""free will"", or ""free choice"", is redundant in relation to the predictive
success of orthodox quantum mechanics. Accordingly, super-indeterminism views
as redundant also, from a technical standpoint, whether an affirmative or a
negative answer is claimed in reference to universal indeterminism as a
necessary precondition for experimenter freedom. Super-indeterminism accounts,
for example, for the circular reasoning which is implicit in the free will

super-Earth atmospheres (Kreidberg et al. 2014). Here we provide a theoretical
context for the formation of super-Earth clouds by determining which
condensates are likely to form under the assumption of chemical equilibrium. We
study super-Earth atmospheres of diverse bulk composition, which are assumed to
form by outgassing from a solid core of chondritic material, following Schaefer
& Fegley (2010). The super-Earth atmospheres that we study arise from planetary
cores made up of individual types of chondritic meteorites. They range from
highly reducing to oxidizing and have carbon to oxygen (C:O) ratios that are
both subsolar and super-solar, thereby spanning a range of atmospheric
composition that is appropriate for low-mass exoplanets. Given the atomic
makeup of these atmospheres, we minimize the global Gibbs free energy of
formation for over 550 gases and condensates to obtain the molecular
composition of the atmospheres over a temperature range of 350-3,000 K. Clouds
should form along the temperature-pressure boundaries where the condensed
species appear in our calculation. We find that the composition of condensate
clouds depends strongly on both the H:O and C:O ratios. For the super-Earth
archetype GJ 1214b, KCl and ZnS are the primary cloud-forming condensates at
solar composition, in agreement with previous work (Morley et al. 2013;

of super-Earth masses and radii. Such measurements are used in internal
structure models to constrain interior compositions of super-Earths. It is now
critically important to quantify the effect of various model assumptions on the
predicted radii. In particular, models often neglect thermal effects, a choice
justified by noting that the thermal expansion of a solid Earth-like planet is
small. However, the thermal effects for water-rich interiors may be
significant. We have systematically explored the extent to which thermal
effects can influence the radii of water-rich super-Earths over a wide range of
masses, surface temperatures, surface pressures and water mass fractions. We
developed temperature-dependent internal structure models of water-rich
super-Earths that include a comprehensive temperature-dependent water equation
of state. We found that thermal effects induce significant changes in their
radii. For example, for super-Earths with 10 per cent water by mass, the radius
increases by up to 0.5$\,$R$_\oplus$ when the surface temperature is increased
from 300 to 1000$\,$K, assuming a surface pressure of 100$\,$bar and an
adiabatic temperature gradient in the water layer. The increase is even larger
at lower surface pressures and/or higher surface temperatures, while changing
the water fraction makes only a marginal difference. These effects are
comparable to current super-Earth radial measurement errors, which can be
better than 0.1$\,$R$_\oplus$. It is therefore important to ensure that the

the Fourier transform of $\mu\in M(\mathbb{T}^d)$. We address the

on a finite set $\Lambda\subset\mathbb{Z}^d$, determine if there is a unique
$\mu\in M(\mathbb{T}^d)$ of minimal norm for which $\hat\mu$ equals this data
on $\Lambda$. Without additional assumptions on $\mu$ and $\Lambda$, our main
theorem shows that the solutions to the super-resolution problem, which we call
minimal extrapolations, depend crucially on the set $\Gamma\subset\Lambda$,
defined in terms of $\mu$ and $\Lambda$. For example, when $\Gamma=0$, the
minimal extrapolations are singular measures supported in the zero set of an
analytic function, and when $\Gamma\geq 2$, the minimal extrapolations are
singular measures supported in the intersection of $\Gamma\choose 2$

nebular gas accretion onto rocky cores and the subsequent evolution of gas
envelopes following the dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. Specifically, we
address mass-loss due to both photo-evaporation and cooling of the planet. We
find that planets shed their outer layers (dozens of percents in mass)

atmospheres shrink in a few Myr to a thickness comparable to the radius of the

blown away by heat coming from the cooling core, while heavier atmospheres cool
and contract on a timescale of Gyr at most. By relating the mass-loss timescale
to the accretion time, we analytically identify a Goldilocks region in the
mass-temperature plane in which low-density super Earths can be found: planets
have to be massive and cold enough to accrete and retain their atmospheres,
while not too massive or cold, such that they do not enter runaway accretion

small eccentricities, and small inclinations. Systems in which super-Earths
coagulate without as much ambient gas, in disks with low solid surface density,
produce rocky planets with wider spacings, larger eccentricities, and larger
mutual inclinations. A combination of both populations can reproduce the
observed distributions of spacings, period ratios, transiting planet
multiplicities, and transit duration ratios exhibited by Kepler super-Earths.
The two populations, both formed in situ, also help to explain observed trends
of eccentricity vs. planet size, and bulk density vs. method of mass
measurement (radial velocities vs. transit timing variations). Simplifications

been proposed to head-start black hole growth from initial seeds with masses
$\sim 10^5\,\rm M_\odot$, which can then reach a billion solar mass while
accreting at the Eddington limit. Here we propose an alternative scenario based
on radiatively inefficient super-critical accretion of stellar-mass holes
embedded in the gaseous circum-nuclear discs (CNDs) expected to exist in the
cores of high redshift galaxies. Our sub-pc resolution hydrodynamical
simulations show that stellar-mass holes orbiting within the central 100 pc of
the CND bind to very high density gas clumps that arise from the fragmentation
of the surrounding gas. Owing to the large reservoir of dense cold gas
available, a stellar-mass black hole allowed to grow at super-Eddington rates
according to the ""slim disc"" solution can increase its mass by 3 orders of
magnitudes within a few million years. These findings are supported by
simulations run with two different hydro codes, RAMSES based on the Adaptive
Mesh Refinement technique and GIZMO based on a new Lagrangian Godunov-type
method, and with similar, but not identical, sub-grid recipes for star
formation, supernova feedback, black hole accretion and feedback. The low

tip vortex cores of complex shape consisting of circular cores with distinct
elongated comet-like tails. We employ large-eddy simulation (LES) to elucidate
the structure and dynamics of the complex tip vortices identified

agreement with the SLPIV results, essentially capturing all vortex core
patterns observed in the field in the tip shear layer. We show that the
visualized vortex patterns are the result of energetic coherent dynamics in the
rotor tip shear layer driven by interactions between the tip vortices and a
second set of counter-rotating spiral vortices intertwined with the tip
vortices. We further show that the mean flow within the region where such rich
coherent dynamics occur satisfies the instability criterion proposed by

transition is reviewed in a pedagogical fashion. The rigidity that emerges in
crystals and glassy liquids is of the same fundamental origin. In both cases,
it corresponds with a breaking of the translational symmetry; analogies with
freezing transitions in spin systems can also be made. The common aspect of
these seemingly distinct phenomena is a spontaneous emergence of the molecular
field, a venerable and well-understood concept. In crucial distinction from
periodic crystallisation, the free energy landscape of a glassy liquid is
vastly degenerate, which gives rise to new length and time scales while
rendering the emergence of rigidity gradual. We obviate the standard notion
that to be mechanically stable a structure must be essentially unique; instead,
we show that bulk degeneracy is perfectly allowed but should not exceed a
certain value. The present microscopic description thus explains both
crystallisation and the emergence of the landscape regime followed by
vitrification in a unified, thermodynamics-rooted fashion. The article contains

accompanied by an electric current. The closing of the electric current occurs
in the crust of a neutron stars in the polar region across the magnetic field.
But the conductivity of the crust along the magnetic field greatly exceeds the
conductivity across the field, so the current penetrates deep into the crust
down up to the super conducting core. The magnetic field, generated by the
accretion current, increases greatly with the depth of penetration due to the
Hall conductivity of the crust is also much larger than the transverse
conductivity. As a result, the current begins to flow mainly in the toroidal
direction, creating a strong longitudinal magnetic field, far exceeding an
initial dipole field. This field exists only in the narrow polar tube of $r$
width, narrowing with the depth, i.e. with increasing of the crust density
$\rho$, $r\propto \rho^{-1/4}$. Accordingly, the magnetic field $B$ in the tube
increases with the depth, $B\propto \rho^{1/2}$, and reaches the value of about
$10^{17}$ Gauss in the core. It destroys super conducting vortices in the core
of a star in the narrow region of the size of the order of ten centimeters.
Because of generated density gradient of vortices they constantly flow into
this dead zone and the number of vortices decreases, the magnetic field of a
star decreases as well. The attenuation of the magnetic field is exponential,
$B=B_0(1+t/\tau)^{-1}$. The characteristic time of decreasing of the magnetic
field $\tau$ is equal to $\tau\simeq 10^3$ years. Thus, the magnetic field of

percent of their total mass. We show that this puzzle is solved if super-Earths
formed late, as the last vestiges of their parent gas disks were about to
clear. This scenario would seem to present fine-tuning problems, but we show
that there are none. Ambient gas densities can span many (up to 9) orders of
magnitude, and super-Earths can still robustly emerge after $\sim$0.1-1 Myr

gas-poor environments where gas dynamical friction has weakened sufficiently to
allow constituent protocores to merge. So little gas is present at the time of
core assembly that cores hardly migrate by disk torques: formation of

super-oscillatory behavior of a single quantum object, a photon. The
super-oscillatory behavior is demonstrated by tight localization of the photon
wavefunction after focusing with a dedicated slit mask designed to create an
interference pattern with a sub-wavelength hotspot. The observed hotspot of the

consists of recovering a high resolution image from its blurred, decimated and
noisy version. The existing algorithms for single image SR use different
strategies to handle the decimation and blurring operators. In addition to the
traditional first-order gradient methods, recent techniques investigate
splitting-based methods dividing the SR problem into up-sampling and
deconvolution steps that can be easily solved. Instead of following this
splitting strategy, we propose to deal with the decimation and blurring
operators simultaneously by taking advantage of their particular properties in
the frequency domain, leading to a new fast SR approach. Specifically, an
analytical solution can be obtained and implemented efficiently for the
Gaussian prior or any other regularization that can be formulated into an
$\ell_2$-regularized quadratic model, i.e., an $\ell_2$-$\ell_2$ optimization
problem. Furthermore, the flexibility of the proposed SR scheme is shown
through the use of various priors/regularizations, ranging from generic image
priors to learning-based approaches. In the case of non-Gaussian priors, we
show how the analytical solution derived from the Gaussian case can be embedded
intotraditional splitting frameworks, allowing the computation cost of existing

rigorous models to prove that highly super-Chandrasekhar, as well as highly
sub-Chandrasekhar, limiting mass white dwarfs are possible to exist. We show
that the mass of highly magnetized or modified Einstein's gravity induced white
dwarfs could be significantly super-Chandrasekhar and such white dwarfs could
altogether have a different mass-limit. On the other hand, type Ia supernovae
(SNeIa), a key to unravel the evolutionary history of the universe, are
believed to be triggered in white dwarfs having mass close to the
Chandrasekhar-limit. However, observations of several peculiar, over- and
under-luminous SNeIa argue for exploding masses widely different from this

considering simplistic, spherical, Newtonian white dwarfs with constant
magnetic fields. Then we relax the Newtonian assumption and consider the
varying fields, however obtain similar results. Finally, we consider a full

stellar winds, motivated by phases in stellar evolution when super-Eddington
energy deposition (via, e.g., unstable fusion, wave heating, or a binary
companion) heats a region near the stellar surface. This appears to occur in
luminous blue variables (LBVs), Type IIn supernovae progenitors, classical
novae, and X-ray bursts. We show that when the wind kinetic power exceeds
Eddington, the photons are trapped and behave like a fluid. Convection does not
play a significant role in the wind energy transport. The wind properties
depend on the ratio of a characteristic speed in the problem vc ~ (Edot
G)^{1/5} (where Edot is the heating rate) to the stellar escape speed near the
heating region vesc(r_h). For vc > vesc(r_h) the wind kinetic power at large
radii Edot_w ~ Edot. For vc < vesc(r_h), most of the energy is used to unbind
the wind material and thus Edot_w < Edot. Multidimensional hydrodynamic
simulations without radiation diffusion using FLASH and one-dimensional
hydrodynamic simulations with radiation diffusion using MESA are in good
agreement with the analytic predictions. The photon luminosity from the wind is
itself super-Eddington but in many cases the photon luminosity is likely
dominated by `internal shocks' in the wind. We discuss the application of our

detected around four days later and lasting for only ~two days, making it both
the fastest follow-up of a nova by Swift and the earliest switch-on of
super-soft emission yet detected. Such an early switch-on time suggests a
combination of a very high velocity outflow and low ejected mass and, together
with the high effective temperature reached by the super-soft emission, a high
mass white dwarf (>1.3 M_sun). The X-ray spectral evolution was followed from
an early epoch where shocked emission was evident, through the entirety of the

edges and thermal continuum temperature. UV grism data were also obtained

canonical tensor model (CTM for short) is a rank-three tensor model formulated

have a similar algebraic structure as the constraints of the ADM formalism of

constructed so that they form a first-class constraint super-Poisson algebra.
This is a straightforward super-extension, and the constraints and their
algebraic structure are formally unchanged from the purely bosonic case, except
for the additional signs associated to the order of the fermionic indices and
dynamical variables. However, this extension of CTM leads to the existence of
negative norm states in the quantized case, and requires some future
improvements as quantum gravity with fermions. On the other hand, since this is

no standard resolution measurement in this field that researchers can use. The
reported resolution has been based on the smallest discernible feature;
although it seems logical but it is not based on the standard textbook
definition, and so far it has ended to a wide range of resolution reports based
on qualitative criteria which can lead to exaggerated resolution values. In
addition, this method has another limitation related to its limited

based power transfer (PT) in the same system has led to the emergence of a new
research area, called wirelessly power communications (WPC). Extensive research
has been conducted on developing WPC theory and techniques, building on the
extremely rich wireless communications litera- ture covering diversified topics
such as transmissions, resource allocations, medium access control and network
protocols and architectures. Despite these research efforts, transforming WPC
from theory to practice still faces many unsolved prob- lems concerning issues
such as mobile complexity, power transfer efficiency, and safety. Furthermore,
the fundamental limits of WPC remain largely unknown. Recent attempts to
address these open issues has resulted in the emergence of numerous new
research trends in the WPC area. A few promising trends are introduced in this
article. From the practical perspective, the use of backscatter antennas can
support WPC for low-complexity passive devices, the design of spiky waveforms
can improve the PT efficiency, and analog spatial decoupling is proposed for
solving the PT-IT near-far problem in WPC. From the theoretic perspective, the
fundamental limits of WPC can be quantified by leveraging recent results on
super-directivity and the limit can be improved by the deployment of
large-scale distributed antenna arrays. Specific research problems along these
trends are discussed, whose solutions can lead to significant advancements in
WPC.",cs.IT,cat:quant-ph,all:super%20conducting

clouds (GMCs) is believed to be important to the control of star formation. For
the most massive and dense clouds, including those in which super star clusters
(SSCs) are born, pressure from reprocessed radiation exerted on dust grains may
disperse a significant portion of the cloud mass back into the interstellar
medium (ISM). Using our radiaton hydrodynamics (RHD) code, Hyperion, we conduct
a series of numerical simulations to test this idea. Our models follow the
evolution of self-gravitating, strongly turbulent clouds in which collapsing
regions are replaced by radiating sink particles representing stellar clusters.
We evaluate the dependence of the star formation efficiency (SFE) on the size
and mass of the cloud and $\kappa$, the opacity of the gas to infrared (IR)
radiation. We find that the single most important parameter determining the
evolutionary outcome is $\kappa$, with $\kappa \gtrsim 15 \text{ cm}^2 \text{
g}^{-1}$ needed to disrupt clouds. For $\kappa = 20-40 \text{ cm}^2 \text{
g}^{-1}$, the resulting SFE=50-70% is similar to empirical estimates for some
SSC-forming clouds. The opacities required for GMC disruption likely apply only
in dust-enriched environments. We find that the subgrid model approach of
boosting the direct radiation force $L/c$ by a ""trapping factor"" equal to a
cloud's mean IR optical depth can overestimate the true radiation force by
factors of $\sim 4-5$. We conclude that feedback from reprocessed IR radiation
alone is unlikely to significantly reduce star formation within GMCs unless

for single-degenerate type Ia supernova progenitors. We point out that earlier
studies of circumbinary obscuration ignored photo-ionisations of the gas by the
emission from the super-soft X-ray source. We revisit the problem using a full,
self-consistent calculation of the ionisation state of the circumbinary

that the circumstellar mass-loss rates required for obcuration of super-soft

rule out the possibility of circumstellar material obscuring super-soft X-ray

a rotation law with positive shear ('super-rotation') are linearly stable. It
is also known that a conducting fluid under the presence of a sufficiently
strong axial electric-current becomes unstable against nonaxisymmetric
disturbances. It is thus suggestive that a cylindric pinch formed by a
homogeneous axial electric-current is stabilized by rotation laws with
$d\Omega/dR \geq 0$. However, for magnetic Prandtl numbers Pm$\neq 1$ and for
slow rotation also rigid rotation and super-rotation support the instability by
lowering their critical Hartmann numbers. For super-rotation in narrow gaps and
for modest rotation rates this double-diffusive instability even exists for
toroidal magnetic fields with rather arbitrary radial profiles, the
current-free profile $B_\phi\propto 1/R$ included. For rigid rotation and for
super-rotation the sign of the azimuthal drift of the nonaxisymmetric
hydromagnetic instability pattern strongly depends on the magnetic Prandtl
number. The pattern counterrotates with the flow for Pm$\ll 1$ and it corotates
for Pm$\gg 1$ while for rotation laws with negative shear the instability
pattern migrates in the direction of the basic rotation for all Pm.
  An axial electric-current of minimal 3.6 kAmp flowing inside or outside the
inner cylinder suffices to realize the double-diffusive instability for
super-rotation in experiments using liquid sodium as the conducting fluid

There is an active debate about whether these planets formed in situ or at
greater distances from the central star and migrated to their current position.
It has been shown that part of their observed properties (e.g., eccentricity
distribution) can be reproduced by N-body simulations of in situ formation
starting with a population of protoplanets of high masses and neglecting the
effects of the disk gas. We plan to reassess the in situ formation of close-in
super-Earths through more complete simulations. We performed N-body simulations
of a population of small planetary embryos and planetesimals that include the
effects of disk-planet interactions (e.g., eccentricity damping, type I
migration). In addition, we also consider the accretion of a primitive
atmosphere from a protoplanetary disk. We find that planetary embryos grow very
quickly well before the gas dispersal, and thus undergo rapid inward migration,
which means that one cannot neglect the effects of a gas disk when considering
the in-situ formation of close-in super-Earths. Owing to their rapid inward
migration, super-Earths reach a compact configuration near the disk's inner
edge whose distribution of orbital parameters matches the observed close-in
super-Earths population poorly. On the other hand, simulations including
eccentricity damping, but no type I migration, reproduce the observed
distributions better. Including the accretion of an atmosphere does not help
reproduce the bulk architecture of observations. Interestingly, we find that
the massive embryos can migrate inside the disk edge while capturing only a
moderately massive hydrogen/helium atmosphere. By this process they avoid
becoming giant planets. The bulk of close-in super-Earths cannot form in situ,

water (H2O) ice lines in the accretion disks around young super-Jovian planets.
We want to know how different heating sources in those disks affect the H2O ice
lines. We simulate 2D rotationally symmetric accretion disks in hydrostatic
equilibrium around super-Jovian exoplanets. The energy terms in our
semi-analytical model -- (1) viscous heating, (2) planetary illumination, (3)
accretional heating, and (4) stellar illumination -- are fed by precomputed

Jupiter-mass planets closer than ~4.5 AU to Sun-like stars do not feature H2O
ice lines, but the most massive super-Jovians can form icy satellites as close

Mars-mass moons. We study a broad range of disk parameters for planets at 5.2
AU and find that the H2O ice lines are universally between ~15 and 30 Jupiter
radii when the last generation of moons is forming. If the abundant population
of super-Jovian planets at ~1 AU formed in situ, then they should lack giant
icy moons because their disks did not host H2O ice in the final stages of
accretion. In the more likely case that these planets migrated to their current
locations from beyond a few AU, they might be orbited by large, H2O-rich moons.

conveyed to voters. Our voting model is constructed by using two types of
voters--herders and independents--and two candidates. Independents conduct
voting based on their fundamental values; on the other hand, herders base their
voting on the number of previous votes. Hence, herders vote for the majority
candidates and obtain information relating to previous votes from their
networks. We discuss the difference between the phases on which the networks

super-normal transition, were identified. The first of these is a transition
between a state in which most voters make the correct choices and a state in
which most of them are wrong. The second is a transition of convergence speed.
The information cascade transition prevails when herder effects are stronger
than the super-normal transition. In the BA and fitness models, the critical
point of the information cascade transition is the same as that of the random

  LiquidFeedback in Germany's Pirate Party",2015-03-26,Steffen Staab,"In recent years, political parties have adopted Online Delegative Democracy
platforms such as LiquidFeedback to organise themselves and their political
agendas via a grassroots approach. A common objection against the use of these
platforms is the delegation system, where a user can delegate his vote to
another user, giving rise to so-called super-voters, i.e. powerful users who
receive many delegations. It has been asserted in the past that the presence of
these super-voters undermines the democratic process, and therefore delegative
democracy should be avoided. In this paper, we look at the emergence of
super-voters in the largest delegative online democracy platform worldwide,
operated by Germany's Pirate Party. We investigate the distribution of power
within the party systematically, study whether super-voters exist, and explore
the influence they have on the outcome of votings conducted online. While we
find that the theoretical power of super-voters is indeed high, we also observe
that they use their power wisely. Super-voters do not fully act on their power
to change the outcome of votes, but they vote in favour of proposals with the
majority of voters in many cases thereby exhibiting a stabilising effect on the
system. We use these findings to present a novel class of power indices that
considers observed voting biases and gives significantly better predictions

porous medium (e.g., a sedimentary rock) filled with an electrolyte (e.g.,

the electrical conductance depends on changes in the drift velocity and the
length of the electric field lines, in addition to the porosity and the
conductance of the electrolyte. We characterized the length of the electric
field lines by a tortuosity and the changes in drift velocity by a constriction
factor. Both the tortuosity and the constriction factor are descriptors of the
pore microstructure. We define a conductance reduction factor to measure the
local contributions of the pore microstructure to the global conductance. It is
shown that the global conductance reduction factor is the product of the
tortuosity squared divided by the constriction factor, thereby proving that the
combined effect of tortuosity and constriction, in addition to the porosity and
conductance of the electrolyte, fully describes the effective electrical
conductance of a porous medium. We show that our tortuosity, constriction
factor, and conductance reduction factor reproduce the electrical conductance
for idealized porous media. They are also applied to Bentheimer sandstone,

producing type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The super-Eddington wind can naturally
prevent the carbon--oxygen white dwarfs (CO WDs) with high mass-accretion rates
from becoming red-giant-like stars. Furthermore, it works in low-metallicity
environments, which may explain SNe Ia observed at high redshifts. In this
article, we systematically investigated the most prominent single-degenerate
WD+MS channel based on the super-Eddington wind scenario. We combined the
Eggleton stellar evolution code with a rapid binary population synthesis (BPS)
approach to predict SN Ia birthrates for the WD+MS channel by adopting the
super-Eddington wind scenario and detailed mass-accumulation efficiencies of
H-shell flashes on the WDs. Our BPS calculations found that the estimated SN Ia
birthrates for the WD+MS channel are ~0.009-0.315*10^{-3}{yr}^{-1} if we adopt
the Eddington accretion rate as the critical accretion rate, which are much
lower than that of the observations (<10% of the observed SN Ia birthrates).
This indicates that the WD+MS channel only contributes a small proportion of
all SNe Ia. The birthrates in this simulation are lower than previous studies,
the main reason of which is that new mass-accumulation efficiencies of H-shell
flashes are adopted. We also found that the critical mass-accretion rate has a
significant influence on the birthrates of SNe Ia. Meanwhile, the results of

around 30-50% of all Sun-like stars. In fact, the Solar System is particularly
outstanding in its lack of ""hot super-Earths"" (or ""mini-Neptunes""). These
planets -- or their building blocks -- may have formed on wider orbits and
migrated inward due to interactions with the gaseous protoplanetary disk. Here,
we use a suite of dynamical simulations to show that gas giant planets act as
barriers to the inward migration of super-Earths initially placed on more
distant orbits. Jupiter's early formation may have prevented Uranus and Neptune
(and perhaps Saturn's core) from becoming hot super-Earths. Our model predicts
that the populations of hot super-Earth systems and Jupiter-like planets should
be anti-correlated: gas giants (especially if they form early) should be rare
in systems with many hot super-Earths. Testing this prediction will constitute
a crucial assessment of the validity of the migration hypothesis for the origin

regime of super-diffusivity dominates the solar surface. Quite habitually this
result is discussed in the framework of fully developed turbulence. But the
debate whether the super-diffusivity is generated by a turbulent dispersion
process, by the advection due to the convective pattern, or by even another
process, is still open, as is the question about the amount of diffusivity at
the scales relevant to the local dynamo process. To understand how such
peculiar diffusion in the solar atmosphere takes places, we compared the
results from two different data-sets (ground-based and space-borne) and
developed a simulation of passive tracers advection by the deformation of a
Voronoi network. The displacement spectra of the magnetic elements obtained by
the data-sets are consistent in retrieving a super-diffusive regime for the
solar photosphere, but the simulation also shows a super-diffusive displacement
spectrum: its competitive advection process can reproduce the signature of
super-diffusion. Therefore, it is not necessary to hypothesize a totally

a baryonic core in high resolution adaptive mesh refinement simulations. We
test the effect that both particle smoothing and particle splitting have on the

Furthermore, we vary the background field intensity, with energy below the
Lyman limit (< 13.6 eV), as may be relevant for the case of metal-free star
formation and super-massive black hole seed formation. We find that using
particle splitting methods greatly increases our particle resolution without
introducing any numerical noise and allows us to achieve converged results over
a wide range of external background fields. Additionally, we find that for
lower values of the background field a lower dark matter particle mass is
required. We define the radius of the core as the point at which the enclosed
baryonic mass dominates over the enclosed dark matter mass. For our simulations
this results in $\rm{R_{core} \sim 5\ pc}$. We find that in order to produce
converged results which are not affected by dark matter particles requires that
the relationship ${M_{\rm{core}} / M_{\rm{DM}}} > 100.0$ be satisfied, where
${M_{\rm{core}}}$ is the enclosed baryon mass within the core and $M_{\rm{DM}}$

When the roughness is larger, the conductance becomes larger than the planar
interface conductance, and the relative increase is found to be close to the

crucial importance for the economic viability of the respective concept.
However the experimental determination of AC-losses is not straightforward
since for short cable samples the distribution of current among the
super-conducting tapes is mainly determined by the contact resistances of the
individual tapes. The resulting inhomogeneous current distribution definitely
falsifies the results. To solve this experimental problem we present a new
experimental technique. The setup is a 2m-long three phase concentric cable
model for which, within each phase, the superconducting tapes (up to 30) are
connected in series. The Cu-braid backwards conductors were assembled in a
rotational symmetric cage type arrangement, such that their self fields at the
cable cancel. If experimental peculiarities of this setup, as the strong
inductive coupling between the phases and the suitable positioning of the
voltage contact leads, are correctly taken into account, the currents can be
controlled independently and the electrical properties of the cable can be
measured unambiguously. In this paper preliminary results are presented. The

According to the core-accretion scenario, the acquisition of their gaseous
envelope must be preceded by the formation of super-critical cores with masses
ten times or larger than that of the Earth. It is natural to link the formation
probability of gas giant planets with the supply of gas and solid in their
natal disks. However, a much richer population of super Earths suggests that 1)
there is no shortage of planetary building-block material, 2) gas giants'
growth barrier is probably associated with whether they can merge into
super-critical cores, and 3) super Earths are probably failed cores which did
not attain sufficient mass to initiate efficient accretion of gas before it is
severely depleted. Here we construct a model based on the hypothesis that
protoplanetary embryos migrated extensively before they were assembled into
bona fide planets. We construct a Hermite-Embryo code based on a unified
viscous-irradiation disk model and a prescription for the embryo-disk tidal
interaction. This code is used to simulate 1) the convergent migration of
embryos, and 2) their close encounters and coagulation. Around the progenitors
of solar-type stars, the progenitor super-critical-mass cores of gas giant
planets primarily form in protostellar disks with relatively high ($\gtrsim
10^{-7} M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) mass accretion rates whereas systems of super

stars are heavier than Jupiter, which raises the question of whether such

simulate the accretion disks around super-Jovian planets and find that giant
moons with masses similar to Mars can form. Our results suggest that the
Galilean moons formed during the final stages of accretion onto Jupiter, when
the circumjovian disk was sufficiently cool. But in contrast to other studies,
with our assumptions, we show that Jupiter was still feeding from the
circumsolar disk and that its principal moons cannot have formed after the
complete photoevaporation of the circumsolar nebula. To counteract the steady
loss of moons into the planet due to type I migration, we propose that the
water ice line around Jupiter and super-Jovian exoplanets acted as a migration
trap for moons. Heat transitions, however, cross the disk during the gap
opening within 10^4 yr, which makes them inefficient as moon traps. This
indicates a fundamental difference between planet and moon formation. We find

  Recycling of Atmospheric Gas",2014-10-17,Rolf Kuiper,"Following Paper I we investigate the properties of atmospheres that form
around small protoplanets embedded in a protoplanetary disc by conducting
hydrodynamical simulations. These are now extended to three dimensions,
employing a spherical grid centred on the planet. Compression of gas is shown
to reduce rotational motions. Contrasting the 2D case, no clear boundary
demarcates bound atmospheric gas from disc material; instead, we find an open
system where gas enters the Bondi sphere at high latitudes and leaves through
the midplane regions, or, vice versa, when the disc gas rotates sub-Keplerian.
The simulations do not converge to a time-independent solution; instead, the
atmosphere is characterized by a time-varying velocity field. Of particular
interest is the timescale to replenish the atmosphere by nebular gas,
$t_\mathrm{replenish}$. It is shown that the replenishment rate,
$M_\mathrm{atm}/t_\mathrm{replenish}$, can be understood in terms of a modified
Bondi accretion rate,
$\sim$$R_\mathrm{Bondi}^2\rho_\mathrm{gas}v_\mathrm{Bondi}$, where
$v_\mathrm{Bondi}$ is set by the Keplerian shear or the magnitude of the
sub-Keplerian motion of the gas, whichever is larger. In the inner disk, the
atmosphere of embedded protoplanets replenishes on a timescale that is shorter
than the Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction (or cooling) timescale. As a result,
atmospheric gas can no longer contract and the growth of these atmospheres
terminates. Future work must confirm whether these findings continue to apply
when the (thermodynamical) idealizations employed in this study are relaxed.
But if shown to be broadly applicable, replenishment of atmospheric gas

superconductivity in the p-type (hole doped) cuprates is proposed. The theory
includes mechanisms to account for e-pair coupling in the superconducting and
pseudogap phases and their inter relations observed in these materials.
  Electron pair coupling in the superconducting phase is facilitated by local
quantum potentials created by static dopants in a mechanism which explains
experimentally observed optimal doping levels and the associated peak in
critical temperature. By contrast, evidence suggests that electrons
contributing to the pseudogap are predominantly coupled by fractal spin waves
(fractons) induced by the fractal arrangement of dopants.
  On another level, the theory offers new insights into the emergence of a
macroscopic quantum potential generated by a fractal distribution of dopants.
This, in turn, leads to the emergence of coherent, macroscopic spin waves and a
second associated macroscopic quantum potential, possibly supported by charge
order. These quantum potentials play two key roles. The first involves the
transition of an expected diffusive process (normally associated with Anderson
localization) in fractal networks, into e-pair coherence. The second involves
the facilitation of tunnelling between localized e-pairs. These combined
effects lead to the merger of the super conducting and pseudo gap phases into a
single coherent condensate at optimal doping. The underlying theory relating to
the diffusion to quantum transition is supported by Coherent Random Lasing,
which can be explained using an analogous approach. As a final step, an
experimental program is outlined to validate the theory and suggests a new
approach to increase the stability of electron pair condensates at higher

competition between fast and slow transport channels is responsible for the

addition, we further discuss the skewness and kurtosis properties of transport

super-resolution approach based on linear manifold approximation of the

high resolution patch in the manifold for a given low-resolution patch. We
developed a novel technique based on the l1 norm sparse graph to learn a set of
low dimensional affine spaces or tangent subspaces of the high-resolution patch
manifold. The optimization problem is then solved based on the learned set of
tangent subspaces. In this paper, we build on our recent work as follows.
First, we consider and analyze each tangent subspace as one point in a
Grassmann manifold, which helps to compute geodesic pairwise distances among
these tangent subspaces. Second, we develop a min-max algorithm to select an
optimal subset of tangent subspaces. This optimal subset reduces the
computational cost while still preserving the quality of the reconstructed

gaugino mass in the superspace formalism of supergravity. In this paper, we
reexamine the gaugino mass term in this formalism by paying particular

discuss super-Diffeomorphism invariance of path-integral measures of charged
superfields. As we will show, the super-Diffeomorphism invariant measure is not
invariant under a super-Weyl transformation, which is the origin of the anomaly
mediated gaugino mass. We show how the anomaly mediated gaugino mass is
expressed as a local operator in a Wilsonian effective action in a
super-Diffeomorphism covariant way. We also obtain a gaugino mass term
independent of the gauge choice of the fictitious super-Weyl symmetry in the
super-Weyl compensator formalism, which reproduces the widely accepted result.
Besides, we discuss how to reconcile the gaugino mass term in the local
Wilsonian effective action and the gaugino mass term appearing in a non-local

major frontiers of exoplanetary science. Currently, extensive efforts are
underway to detect molecules, particularly H2O, in super-Earth atmospheres. In
the present work, we develop a systematic set of strategies to identify and
observe potentially H2O-rich super-Earths that provide the best prospects for
characterizing their atmospheres using existing instruments. Firstly, we
provide analytic prescriptions and discuss factors that need to be taken into
account while planning and interpreting observations of super-Earth radii and
spectra. We discuss how observations in different spectral bandpasses constrain
different atmospheric properties of a super-Earth, including radius and
temperature of the planetary surface as well as the mean molecular mass, the
chemical composition and thermal profile of the atmosphere. In particular, we
caution that radii measured in certain bandpasses can induce biases in the
interpretation of the interior compositions. Secondly, we investigate the
detectability of H2O-rich super-Earth atmospheres using the HST WFC3
spectrograph as a function of the planetary properties and stellar brightness.
We find that highly irradiated super-Earths orbiting bright stars, such as 55
Cancri e, present better candidates for atmospheric characterization compared
to cooler planets such as GJ 1214b even if the latter orbit lower-mass stars.
Besides being better candidates for both transmission and emission

is possible. In particular, we establish a sharp phase transition for the
relationship between the cutoff frequency ($m$) and the separation ($\Delta$).
If $m > 1/\Delta + 1$, our estimator converges to the true values at an inverse

  Our results involve making novel connections between {\em extremal functions}

transition for their condition number which in turn allows us to give the first
noise tolerance bounds for the matrix pencil method. Moreover we show that our
methods can be interpreted as giving preconditioners for Vandermonde matrices,

As consequence of this unitary description, rather unexpectedly for pure vapor

further consider the extension in which more based arms could be
probabilistically triggered based on the outcomes of already triggered arms.
The reward of the super arm depends on the outcomes of all played arms, and it
only needs to satisfy two mild assumptions, which allow a large class of
nonlinear reward instances. We assume the availability of an offline
(\alpha,\beta)-approximation oracle that takes the means of the outcome
distributions of arms and outputs a super arm that with probability {\beta}

On the hedging market, the upper price of an (exotic) option is derived

Nebula, and show that the explosion of an ecSN within an ordinary super-AGB
wind can explain the LC features. We conclude that SN 1054 could have been a
Type IIn SN without any extra extreme mass loss which was previously suggested
to be necessary to account for its early high luminosity. We also show that our
LCs match Type IIn SNe with an early plateau phase (`Type IIn-P') and suggest
that they are ecSNe within super-AGB winds. Although some ecSNe can be bright
in the optical spectral range due to the large progenitor radius, their X-ray
luminosity from the interaction does not necessarily get as bright as other
Type IIn SNe whose optical luminosities are also powered by the interaction.
Thus, we suggest that optically-bright X-ray-faint Type IIn SNe can emerge from
ecSNe. Optically-faint Type IIn SNe, such as SN 2008S, can also originate from
ecSNe if their H-rich envelope masses are small. Some of them can be observed
as `Type IIn-b' SNe due to the small H-rich envelope mass.",astro-ph.HE,cat:quant-ph,all:super%20conducting

magnetized accretion disks. We have implemented this model in the general
relativisic radiation magnetohydrodynamic (GRRMHD) code \koral, using results
from local shearing sheet simulations of the magnetorotational instability to
fix the parameters of the dynamo. With the inclusion of this dynamo, we are
able to run 2D axisymmetric GRRMHD simulations of accretion disks for
arbitrarily long times. The simulated disks exhibit sustained turbulence, with
the poloidal and toroidal magnetic field components driven towards a state
similar to that seen in 3D studies. Using this dynamo code, we present a set of
long-duration global simulations of super-Eddington, optically-thick disks
around non-spinning and spinning black holes. Super-Eddington disks around
non-rotating black holes exhibit a surprisingly large efficiency,
$\eta\approx0.04$, independent of the accretion rate, where we measure
efficiency in terms of the total energy output, both radiation and mechanical,
flowing out to infinity. Super-Eddington disks around spinning black holes are
even more efficient, and appear to extract black hole rotational energy through
a process similar to the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. All the simulated models
are characterized by highly super-Eddington radiative fluxes collimated along
the rotation axis. We also present a set of simulations that were designed to
have Eddington or slightly sub-Eddington accretion rates ($\dot{M} \lesssim
2\dot M_{\rm Edd}$). None of these models reached a steady state. Instead, the
disks collapsed as a result of runaway cooling, presumably because of a thermal

Results: We present the discovery of a massive planet around the giant star

the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA) and the European VLBI Network
(EVN) from February 2011 to October 2012, together with contemporaneous
high-energy gamma-ray light curves obtained by the Fermi-LAT. During this
period, an elevated level of the M87 flux is reported at VHE gamma rays. We
detected a remarkable increase of the radio flux density from the unresolved
jet base (radio core) with VERA at 22 and 43GHz coincident with the VHE
activity. Meanwhile, we confirmed with EVN at 5GHz that HST-1 (an alternative
gamma-ray production candidate site) remained quiescent in terms of its flux
density and structure. These results in the radio bands strongly suggest that
the VHE gamma-ray activity in 2012 originates in the jet base within 0.03pc or
56 Schwarzschild radii from the central supermassive black hole. We further
conducted VERA astrometry for the M87 core during the flaring period, and
detected core shifts between 22 and 43GHz. We also discovered a clear
frequency-dependent evolution of the radio core flare at 43, 22 and 5GHz; the
radio flux density increased more rapidly at higher frequencies with a larger
amplitude, and the light curves clearly showed a time-lag between the peaks at
22 and 43GHz. This indicates that a new radio-emitting component was created
near the black hole in the period of the VHE event, and then propagated outward
with progressively decreasing synchrotron opacity. By combining these results,
we estimated an apparent speed of the newborn component, and derived a
sub-luminal speed of less than ~0.2c. This value is significantly slower than
the super-luminal (~1.1c) features that appeared from the core during the

and the complexities thereby revealed ask for a dynamical origin. Sub-solidus
convection was one of the early suggestions to explain the seismic anisotropy,
but it requires an unstable density gradient either from thermal or
compositional origin, or from both. Temperature and composition profiles in the
inner core are computed using a unidimensional model of core evolution
including diffusion in the inner core and fractional crystallisation at the
inner core boundary (ICB). The thermal conductivity of the core has been
recently revised upwardly and, moreover, found to increase with depth. Values
of the heat flow across the core mantle boundary (CMB) sufficient to maintain
convection in the whole outer core are not sufficient to make the temperature
in the inner core super-isentropic and therefore prone to thermal instability.
An unreasonably high CMB heat flow is necessary to this end. The compositional
stratification results from a competition of the increase of the concentration
of light elements in the outer core with inner core growth, which makes the
inner core concentration also increase, and of the decrease of the liquidus,
which makes the partition coefficient decrease as well as the concentration of
light elements in the solid. While the latter (destabilizing) effect dominates
at small inner core sizes, the former takes over for a large inner core. The
turnover point is encountered for an inner core about half its current size in
the case of S, but much larger for the case of O. The combined thermal and
compositional buoyancy is stabilizing and solid-state convection in the inner

that high-magnification events and massive planets are favored by planet
detections, which is consistent with previous expectation. However, we notice
that extremely high-magnification events are less sensitive to planets, which
is possibly because the 10 min sampling of KMTNet is not intensive enough to
capture the subtle anomalies that occur near the peak. This suggests that while
KMTNet observations can be systematically analyzed without reference to any
follow-up data, follow-up observations will be essential in extracting the full
science potential of very high-magnification events. The uniformly high-cadence
observations expected for KMTNet also result in $\sim 55\%$ of all detected

expected upturn of the survival probability of low energy solar boron

efficiently with electron neutrino through a MSW resonance happened in Sun. One
may naturally expect that a similar resonance should happen for neutrinos
propagating in Earth matter. We study the flavor conversion of this super-light
sterile neutrino with active neutrinos in Earth matter. We find that the
scenario of the super-light sterile neutrino can easily pass through possible
constraints from experiments which can test the Earth matter effect in
oscillation of neutrinos. Interestinlgy, we find that this is because the
naively expected resonant conversion disappears or is significantly suppressed
due to the presence of a potential $V_n$ which arises from neutral current
interaction of neutrino with neutrons in matter. In contrast, the neutron
number density in the Sun is negligible and the effect of $V_n$ is effectively
switched off. This enables the MSW resonance in Sun needed in oscillation of
the super-light sterile neutrino with solar electron neutrinos. It's
interesting to note that it is the different situation in the Sun and in the

that contains as subgraphs the skeletons of solution networks. We introduce the
directed super-structure as a natural generalization of its undirected

network structure learning where the score of a network decomposes into local
scores of its nodes. Results: We show that exact Bayesian network structure
learning can be carried out in non-uniform polynomial time if the
super-structure has bounded treewidth, and in linear time if in addition the
super-structure has bounded maximum degree. Furthermore, we show that if the

coupled with star formation via positive feedback, may account for early growth

estimate the possible growth rates and duty cycles of these episodes, both
assuming slim accretion disk solutions, and adopting the results of recent
numerical simulations. The angular momentum of gas joining the accretion disk
determines the length of the accretion episodes, and the final mass a MBH can
reach. The latter can be related to the gas velocity dispersion, and in
galaxies with low-angular momentum gas the MBH can get to a higher mass. When
the host galaxy is able to sustain inflow rates at 1-100 msunyr, replenishing
and circulation lead to a sequence of short (~1e4-1e7 years), heavily obscured
accretion episodes that increase the growth rates, with respect to an
Eddington-limited case, by several orders of magnitude. Our model predicts that
the ratio of MBH accretion rate to star formation rate is 1e2 or higher,
leading, at early epochs, to a ratio of MBH to stellar mass higher than the

oceans, implying that most super-Earths should be entirely covered in water,
so-called waterworlds. This is important because waterworlds lack a silicate
weathering thermostat so their climate is predicted to be less stable than that
of planets with exposed continents. In other words, the continuously habitable
zone for waterworlds is much narrower than for Earth-like planets. A planet's
water is partitioned, however, between a surface reservoir, the ocean, and an
interior reservoir, the mantle. Plate tectonics transports water between these
reservoirs on geological timescales. Degassing of melt at mid-ocean ridges and
serpentinization of oceanic crust depend negatively and positively on seafloor
pressure, respectively, providing a stabilizing feedback on long-term ocean
volume. Motivated by Earth's approximately steady-state deep water cycle, we
develop a two-box model of the hydrosphere and derive steady-state solutions to
the water partitioning on terrestrial planets. Critically, hydrostatic seafloor
pressure is proportional to surface gravity, so super-Earths with a deep water
cycle will tend to store more water in the mantle. We conclude that a
tectonically active terrestrial planet of any mass can maintain exposed
continents if its water mass fraction is less than ~0.2%, dramatically
increasing the odds that super-Earths are habitable. The greatest source of
uncertainty in our study is Earth's current mantle water inventory: the greater
its value, the more robust planets are to inundation. Lastly, we discuss how
future missions can test our hypothesis by mapping the oceans and continents of

According to this mechanism under the low salt concentrations electrical

achieved temperature and the flare GOES class, such that ""super-hot""

observed correlation differs significantly from that of GOES-derived
temperatures, and from previous studies. A nearly-ubiquitous association with
high emission measures, electron densities, and instantaneous thermal energies
suggests that super-hot plasmas are physically distinct from cooler, ~10-20 MK
GOES plasmas, and that they require substantially greater energy input during
the flare. High thermal energy densities suggest that super-hot flares require
strong coronal magnetic fields, exceeding ~100 G, and that both the plasma

For the CO WD masses from 0.5 to $1.378\,{M}_\odot$ and accretion rates in the
range from $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-5}\,{M}_\odot\,\mbox{yr}^{-1}$, we simulated the
accretion of solar-composition material onto CO WDs using the state-of-the-art
stellar evolution code of {\sc MESA}. For comparison with the steady-state
models (e.g \citet{nskh07}), we firstly ignored the contribution from nuclear
burning to the luminosity when determining the Eddington accretion rate and
found that the properties of H burning in our accreting CO WD models are
similar to those from the steady-state models, except that the critical
accretion rates at which the WDs turn into red giants or H-shell flashes occur
on their surfaces are slightly higher than those from the steady-state models.
However, the super-Eddington wind is triggered at much lower accretion rates,
than previously thought, when the contribution of nuclear burning to the total

with high accretion rates from becoming red giants, thus presenting an

content. The stability of the volatile components is to be examined, because
hot super-Earths undergo photo-evaporative mass loss. While several studies
investigated the impact of photo-evaporative mass loss on hydrogen-helium
envelopes, there are few studies as to the impact on water-vapor envelopes. To
obtain theoretical prediction to future observations, we also investigate the
relationships among masses, radii, and semimajor axes of water-rich
sub/super-Earths that have undergone photo-evaporative mass loss. We simulate
the interior structure and evolution of sub/super-Earths that consist of a
rocky core surrounded by a water envelope, including mass loss due to the

radius, and semimajor axis in which sub/super-Earths never retain water
envelopes in 1-10 Gyr. This would provide an essential piece of information for
understanding the origin of close-in low-mass planets. The current

gas-property gradients and red central galaxies observed to exist in the cores
of galaxy clusters. Thermal conduction has been suggested as a mechanism that
can help bring simulations of cluster cores into better alignment with
observations by stabilizing the feedback processes that regulate gas cooling,
but this idea has not yet been well tested with cosmological numerical
simulations. Here we present cosmological simulations of ten galaxy clusters
performed with five different levels of isotropic Spitzer conduction, which
alters both the cores and outskirts of clusters, but not dramatically. In the
cores, conduction flattens central temperature gradients, making them nearly
isothermal and slightly lowering the central density but failing to prevent a
cooling catastrophe there. Conduction has little effect on temperature
gradients outside of cluster cores because outward conductive heat flow tends
to inflate the outer parts of the intracluster medium (ICM) instead of raising
its temperature. In general, conduction tends reduce temperature inhomogeneity
in the ICM, but our simulations indicate that those homogenizing effects would
be extremely difficult to observe in ~5 keV clusters. Outside the virial
radius, our conduction implementation lowers the gas densities and temperatures
because it reduces the Mach numbers of accretion shocks. We conclude that
despite the numerous small ways in which conduction alters the structure of

conclusively revealed the nature of ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) at the
high-luminosity end of the distribution (those with Lx > 1e40 erg/s). These are
of particular interest because the luminosity requires either super-Eddington
accretion onto a black hole of mass ~10 Msun, or more standard accretion onto
an intermediate-mass black hole. Super-Eddington accretion models predict
strong outflowing winds, making atomic absorption lines a key diagnostic of the
nature of extreme ULXs. To search for such features, we have undertaken a long,
500 ks observing campaign on Holmberg IX X-1 with Suzaku. This is the most
sensitive dataset in the iron K bandpass for a bright, isolated ULX to date,
yet we find no statistically significant atomic features in either emission or
absorption; any undetected narrow features must have equivalent widths less
than 15-20 eV at 99% confidence. These limits are far below the >150 eV lines
expected if observed trends between mass inflow and outflow rates extend into
the super-Eddington regime, and in fact rule out the line strengths observed
from disk winds in a variety of sub-Eddington black holes. We therefore cannot
be viewing the central regions of Holmberg IX X-1 through any substantial
column of material, ruling out models of spherical super-Eddington accretion.
If Holmberg IX X-1 is a super-Eddington source, any associated outflow must
have an anisotropic geometry. Finally, the lack of iron emission suggests that
the stellar companion cannot be launching a strong wind, and that Holmberg IX
X-1 must primarily accrete via roche-lobe overflow.",astro-ph.HE,cat:quant-ph,all:super%20conducting

The weak measurement acts gently on quantum system and do not force the system

prove that the super quantum discord in the post measured state is equal to the

dwarf, invoking the phenomenon of flux freezing. This opens the multiple

In previously published experimental results, change of conductivity by 10 or
more orders of magnitude occurred both in the absence of external influences
(spontaneously), and under the influence of an applied electric field, as well
as other initiating factors (such as uniaxial pressure) . In a model of hopping
conduction mechanism it is shown, that switching in the conduction states under
the action of external field significantly (by orders of magnitude) below
threshold can be associated with a high-resistance state instability that
results from the sequence of ""shorting"" (reversible soft breakdown) of narrow
insulating gaps between regions with relatively high conductivity. Increasing
the field strength in the remaining insulating gaps ultimately leads to the
formation of a conducting channel between the external electrodes and switching
conductivity of the composite film sample in a state of high conductivity. This
cascade model is essentially based on the transition from the usual description
of the charge tunneling through single independent insulating gap to take into
account correlations between adjacent gaps. In the frame of developed model

Programming (ASP) systems, and in particular the grounding components of ASP
systems, is an important topic in ASP. In recent years, the Magic Set method
has received some interest in this setting, and a variant of it, called DMS,
has been proposed for ASP. However, this technique has a caveat, because it is
not correct (in the sense of being query-equivalent) for all ASP programs. In
recent work, a large fragment of ASP programs, referred to as super-coherent
programs, has been identified, for which DMS is correct. The fragment contains
all programs which possess at least one answer set, no matter which set of
facts is added to them. Two open question remained: How complex is it to
determine whether a given program is super-coherent? Does the restriction to
super-coherent programs limit the problems that can be solved? Especially the
first question turned out to be quite difficult to answer precisely. In this
paper, we formally prove that deciding whether a propositional program is
super-coherent is \Pi^P_3-complete in the disjunctive case, while it is
\Pi^P_2-complete for normal programs. The hardness proofs are the difficult
part in this endeavor: We proceed by characterizing the reductions by the
models and reduct models which the ASP programs should have, and then provide
instantiations that meet the given specifications. Concerning the second
question, we show that all relevant ASP reasoning tasks can be transformed into
tasks over super-coherent programs, even though this transformation is more of
theoretical than practical interest.

growth phenomenon. As the system size $P$ measured as population in cities or
active users in online communities increases, the total activities $X$ measured
as GDP or number of new patents, crimes in cities generated by these people
also increases but in a faster rate. This accelerating growth phenomenon can be
well described by a super-linear power law $X \propto P^{\gamma}$($\gamma>1$).
However, the explanation on this phenomenon is still lack. In this paper, we
propose a modeling framework called growing random geometric models to explain
the super-linear relationship. A growing network is constructed on an abstract
geometric space. The new coming node can only survive if it just locates on an
appropriate place in the space where other nodes exist, then new edges are
connected with the adjacent nodes whose number is determined by the density of
existing nodes. Thus the total number of edges can grow with the number of
nodes in a faster speed exactly following the super-linear power law. The
models cannot only reproduce a lot of observed phenomena in complex networks,
e.g., scale-free degree distribution and asymptotically size-invariant
clustering coefficient, but also resemble the known patterns of cities, such as
fractal growing, area-population and diversity-population scaling relations,
etc. Strikingly, only one important parameter, the dimension of the geometric

dependence of the resistivity. Intriguingly, the resistivity perpendicular to
the CuO$_2$ planes, $\rho_c(T)$, shows both metallic ($d\rho_c/dT > 0$) and
semi-conducting ($d\rho_c/dT<0$) behavior. We shed light on this puzzle by
calculating $\rho_c$ for the two-dimensional Hubbard model within plaquette
cellular dynamical mean-field theory and strong-coupling continuous-time
quantum Monte Carlo as the impurity solver. The temperature, $T$, and doping,
$\delta$, dependencies of $\rho_c$ are controlled by the first-order transition
between pseudogap and correlated metal phases from which superconductivity can
emerge. On the large doping side of the transition $\rho_c(T)$ is metallic,
while on the low-doping side $\rho_c(T)$ changes from metallic to
semi-conducting behavior with decreasing $T$. As a function of doping, the jump
in $\rho_c$ across the first-order transition evolves into a sharp crossover at
higher temperatures. This crossover coincides with the pseudogap temperature
$T^*$ in the single-particle density of states, the spin susceptibility and
other observables. Such coincidence in crossovers is expected along the
continuation of the first-order transition into the super-critical regime,

  Averaging",2012-10-18,Bo Yuan,"The motivation for this paper is to apply Bayesian structure learning using
Model Averaging in large-scale networks. Currently, Bayesian model averaging
algorithm is applicable to networks with only tens of variables, restrained by
its super-exponential complexity. We present a novel framework, called
LSBN(Large-Scale Bayesian Network), making it possible to handle networks with
infinite size by following the principle of divide-and-conquer. The method of
LSBN comprises three steps. In general, LSBN first performs the partition by
using a second-order partition strategy, which achieves more robust results.
LSBN conducts sampling and structure learning within each overlapping community
after the community is isolated from other variables by Markov Blanket. Finally
LSBN employs an efficient algorithm, to merge structures of overlapping
communities into a whole. In comparison with other four state-of-art
large-scale network structure learning algorithms such as ARACNE, PC, Greedy
Search and MMHC, LSBN shows comparable results in five common benchmark
datasets, evaluated by precision, recall and f-score. What's more, LSBN makes
it possible to learn large-scale Bayesian structure by Model Averaging which
used to be intractable. In summary, LSBN provides an scalable and parallel
framework for the reconstruction of network structures. Besides, the complete
information of overlapping communities serves as the byproduct, which could be
used to mine meaningful clusters in biological networks, such as
protein-protein-interaction network or gene regulatory network, as well as in
social network.",cs.LG,cat:quant-ph,all:super%20conducting

with silicates and iron being the most common minerals in their interiors.
However, the true chemical diversity of rocky planets orbiting other stars is

compositions of super-Earths (exoplanets with masses of 1 - 10 Earth masses),
and are typically interpreted with planetary interior models that assume
Earth-centric oxygen-rich compositions. Using such models, the super-Earth 55
Cancri e (mass of 8 Earth masses, radius of 2 Earth radii) has been suggested
to bear an interior composition consisting of Fe, silicates, and an envelope
(>= 10% by mass) of super-critical water. We report that the mass and radius of
55 Cancri e can also be explained by a carbon-rich solid interior made of Fe,
C, SiC, and/or silicates and without a volatile envelope. While the data allow
Fe mass fractions of up to 40%, a wide range of C, SiC and/or silicate mass
fractions are possible. A carbon-rich 55 Cancri e is also plausible if its
protoplanetary disk bore the same composition as its host star, which has been
reported to be carbon-rich. However, more precise estimates of the stellar
elemental abundances and observations of the planetary atmosphere are required

we estimate the progenitor mass of SN 2009dc, one of the extremely luminous SNe

super-Chandrasekhar-mass (super-Ch-mass) WDs are constructed, and multi-color
light curves (LCs) are calculated. The comparison between our calculations and
the observations of SN 2009dc suggests that the exploding WD has a super-Ch
mass of 2.2-2.4 solar masses, producing 1.2-1.4 solar masses of Ni-56, if the
extinction by its host galaxy is negligible. If the extinction is significant,
the exploding WD is as massive as \sim2.8 solar masses, and \sim1.8 solar
masses of Ni-56 is necessary to account for the observations. Whether the
host-galaxy extinction is significant or not, the progenitor WD must have a
thick carbon-oxygen layer in the outermost zone (20-30% of the WD mass), which
explains the observed low expansion velocity of the ejecta and the presence of

extrasolar planets. This has become possible with measurements of radii and

better understand planet formation is an important, but difficult undertaking.
Our approach is to develop a model which can make testable predictions for all
these observational methods. We continue to describe how we have extended our
formation model into a self-consistently coupled formation and evolution model.
We show how we calculate the internal structure of the solid core and
radiogenic heating. We also improve the protoplanetary disk model. Finally, we
conduct population synthesis calculations. We present how the planetary
mass-radius relationship of planets with primordial H/He envelopes forms and
evolves in time. The basic shape of the M-R relation can be understood from the
core accretion model. Low-mass planets cannot bind massive envelopes, while
super-critical cores necessarily trigger runway gas accretion, leading to
""forbidden"" zones in the M-R plane. For a given mass, there is a considerable
diversity of radii. We compare the synthetic M-R relation with the observed
one, finding good agreement for a>0.1 AU. The synthetic radius distribution is
characterized by a strong increase towards small R, and a second, lower local
maximum at ~1 Jovian radius. The increase towards small radii reflects the
increase of the mass function towards low M. The second local maximum is due to
the fact that radii are nearly independent of mass for giant planets. A
comparison of the synthetic radius distribution with Kepler data shows
agreement for R>2 Earth radii, but divergence for smaller radii. We predict

temperature lapse rate becomes superadiabatic. Beyond this radial distance heat
conduction fails to be efficient enough to keep the temperature gradient

a physical consequence of the too steep (superadiabatic) temperature gradient

tidal perturbation induced by Earth and super-Earth mass planets is generally
too weak to significantly modify the structure of the disk, the interaction is
potentially strong enough to cause the planets to undergo rapid type I
migration. This physical process may provide a source of short-period
super-Earths, though it may also pose a challenge to the emergence and
retention of cores on long-period orbits with sufficient mass to evolve into
gas giants. Previous numerical simulations have shown that the type I migration
rate sensitively depends upon the circumstellar disk's properties, particularly
the temperature and surface density gradients. Here, we derive these structure
parameters for 1) a self-consistent viscous-disk model based on a constant
\alpha-prescription, 2) an irradiated disk model that takes into account
heating due to the absorption of stellar photons, and 3) a layered-accretion
disk model with variable \alpha-parameter. We show that in the inner
viscously-heated regions of typical protostellar disks, the horseshoe and
corotation torques of super-Earths can exceed their differential Lindblad
torque and cause them to undergo outward migration. However, the temperature
profile due to passive stellar irradiation causes type I migration to be
inwards throughout much of the disk. For disks in which there is outwards
migration, we show that location and the mass range of the ""planet traps""
depends on some uncertain assumptions adopted for these disk models. Competing
physical effects may lead to dispersion in super-Earths' mass-period
distribution.",astro-ph.EP,cat:quant-ph,all:super%20conducting

Earth-sized planet to be undergoing plate tectonics. Generally, viscosity and
thermal conductivity increase with pressure while thermal expansivity
decreases, resulting in lower convective vigor in the deep mantle. According to
conventional thinking, this might result in no convection in a super-Earth's
deep mantle. Here we evaluate this. First, we here extend the density
functional theory (DFT) calculations of post-perovskite activation enthalpy of
to a pressure of 1 TPa. The activation volume for diffusion creep becomes very
low at very high pressure, but nevertheless for the largest super-Earths the
viscosity along an adiabat may approach 1030 Pa s in the deep mantle. Second,
we use these calculated values in numerical simulations of mantle convection
and lithosphere dynamics of planets with up to ten Earth masses. The models
assume a compressible mantle including depth-dependence of material properties
and plastic yielding induced plate tectonics. Results confirm the likelihood of
plate tectonics and show a novel self-regulation of deep mantle temperature.
The deep mantle is not adiabatic; instead internal heating raises the
temperature until the viscosity is low enough to facilitate convective loss of
the radiogenic heat, which results in a super-adiabatic temperature profile and
a viscosity increase with depth of no more than ~3 orders of magnitude,
regardless of the viscosity increase that is calculated for an adiabat.
Convection in large super-Earths is characterised by large upwellings and
small, time-dependent downwellings. If a super-Earth was extremely hot/molten
after its formation, it is thus likely that even after billions of years its
deep interior is still extremely hot and possibly substantially molten with a

solving a simple convex optimization problem, which can essentially be
reformulated as a semidefinite program. This holds provided that the distance
between sources is at least $2/f_c$. This result extends to higher dimensions

piecewise smooth function by resolving the discontinuity points with infinite
precision as well. We also show that the theory and methods are robust to

in B in fields below a few tens of mT with a crossover to a positive MR at
higher fields, while in a perpendicular current direction we observe a giant

explained by a hopping magneto-conductance via non-zero angular momentum
orbitals, and by the magneto-conductance of inhomogeneous media. The linear
orbital NMR is a unique signature of the broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS) in

integration in the vicinity of the cusps. A regularization that is adopted by
practitioners by allowing one to use spinor helicity formalism, on the one
hand, and systematically go to higher orders of perturbation theory is based on
a version of dimensional regularization, known as Four-Dimensional Helicity
scheme. Recently it was demonstrated that its use for the super Wilson loop at

we exhibit the origin for these effects and demonstrate how one can undo this

mixing of conformal operators in conformal theories when one uses dimensional
regularization. The rotation matrix to the diagonal basis is found by means of
computing the anomaly in the Ward identity for the conformal boost. Presently,
we apply this ideology to the super Wilson loop. We compute the one-loop

discovered through radial velocity and transit surveys. Regardless of their
formation mechanism, a key evolution issue is the efficiency of their retention
near their host stars. If these planets attained their present-day orbits
during or shortly after the T Tauri phase of their host stars, a large fraction
would have encountered intense stellar magnetic field. Since these planets have
a higher conductivity than the atmosphere of their stars, the magnetic flux
tube connecting the planet and host star would slip though the envelope of the
star faster than across the planet. The induced electro-motive force across the
planet's diameter leads to a potential drop which propagates along a flux tube
away from the planet with an Alfven speed. The foot of the flux tube sweeps
across the stellar surface and the potential drop drives a DC current analogous
to that proposed for the Io-Jupiter electrodynamic interaction. The ohmic
dissipation of this current produces potentially observable hot spots in the
star envelope. The current heats the planet and leads to a Lorrentz torque
which drives the planet's orbit to evolve toward circularization and
synchronization with the star's spin. The net effect is the damping of the
planet's orbital eccentricity. Around slowly (rapidly) spinning stars, this
process also causes rocky planets with periods less than a few days to undergo
orbital decay (expansion/stagnation) within a few Myr. In principle, this
effect can determine the retention efficiency of short-period hot Earths. We
also estimate the ohmic dissipation in these planets and show that it can lead

  Galaxies at High Redshift",2011-11-23,Abraham Loeb,"We identify a physical mechanism that would have resulted in rapid, obscured
growth of seed super-massive black-holes in galaxies at z>6. Specifically, we
find that the density at the centre of typical high redshift galaxies was at a
level where the Bondi accretion rate implies a diffusion speed of photons that
was slower than the gravitational infall velocity, resulting in photons being
trapped within the accretion flow and advected into the black-hole. We show
that there is a range of black-hole masses (M_bh ~ 10^3-10^5 solar masses)
where the accretion flow traps radiation, corresponding to black-holes that
were massive enough to generate a photon trapping accretion flow, but small
enough that their Bondi radii did not exceed the isothermal scale height of
self-gravitating gas. Under these conditions we find that the accretion reaches
levels far in excess of the Eddington rate. A prediction of this scenario is
that X-ray number counts of active galactic nuclei at z>6 would exhibit a
cutoff at the low luminosities corresponding to black-hole masses below ~10^5
solar masses. At low redshifts we find photon trapping to be unimportant
because it could only occur in rare low spin halos, and would require
black-hole masses in excess of expectations from the observed black-hole - halo
mass relation. The super-Eddington growth of ~10^5 solar mass seed black-holes

super-massive black-holes at z~6-7, less than a billion years after the Big

radial velocity technique. But at the accuracy level of 1 m.s-1, required for
super-Earth characterization, stability of fiber-fed spectrograph performance
is crucial considering variable observing conditions such as seeing, guiding
and centering errors and, telescope vignetting. In fiber-fed spectrographs such
as HARPS or SOPHIE, the fiber link scrambling properties are one of the main
issues. Both the stability of the fiber near-field uniformity at the
spectrograph entrance and of the far-field illumination on the echelle grating
(pupil) are critical for high-precision radial velocity measurements due to the
spectrograph geometrical field and aperture aberrations. We conducted tests on
the SOPHIE spectrograph at the 1.93-m OHP telescope to measure the instrument
sensitivity to the fiber link light feeding conditions: star decentering,
telescope vignetting by the dome,and defocussing.
  To significantly improve on current precision, we designed a fiber link
modification considering the spectrograph operational constraints. We have
developed a new link which includes a piece of octagonal-section fiber, having
good scrambling properties, lying inside the former circular-section fiber, and
we tested the concept on a bench to characterize near-field and far-field
scrambling properties.
  This modification has been implemented in spring 2011 on the SOPHIE

calculated upper limits on the bolometric luminosities of the progenitors

minimized the electronic repulsion of the electrons, while still providing
adequate enough attraction so as to bind the excess elections into orbitals. We

strongest evidence for the existence of intermediate mass black holes. We
conduct an ongoing monitoring campaign with the Swift X-ray Telescope and found
that HLX-1 showed two fast rise and exponential decay with increases in the
count rate of a factor ~40 separated by 375+/-13 days. We obtained new
XMM-Newton and Chandra dedicated pointings that were triggered at the lowest
and highest luminosities, respectively. The unabsorbed luminosities ranged from
1.9x10^40 to 1.25x10^42 erg/s. We confirm here the detection of spectral state
transitions from HLX-1 reminiscent of Galactic black hole binaries: at high
luminosities, the X-ray spectrum showed a thermal state dominated by a disk
component with temperatures of 0.26 keV at most, and at low luminosities the
spectrum is dominated by a hard power law with a photon index in the range
1.4-2.1, consistent with a hard state. The source was also observed in a steep
power law state. In the thermal state, the luminosity of the disk component
appears to scale with the fourth power of the inner disk temperature which
supports the presence of an optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disk.
The low fractional variability (rms of 9+/-9%) in this state also suggests the
presence of a dominant disk. The spectral changes and long-term variability of
the source cannot be explained by variations of the beaming angle and are not
consistent with the source being in a super-Eddington accretion state. HLX-1 is
thus an unusual ULX as it is similar to Galactic black hole binaries, which
have non-beamed and sub-Eddington emission, but with luminosities 3 orders of
magnitude higher. In this picture, a lower limit on the mass of the black hole

exceeding 30 megakelvins. High observed emission measure, as well as inference
of electron thermalization within the small source region, both provide
evidence of high densities at the looptop; typically more than an order of
magnitude above ambient. Where some investigators have suggested such density
enhancement results from a rapid enhancement in the magnetic field strength, we
propose an alternative model, based on Petschek reconnection, whereby looptop
plasma is heated and compressed by slow magnetosonic shocks generated
self-consistently through flux retraction following reconnection. Under steady
conditions such shocks can enhance density by no more than a factor of four.
These steady shock relations (Rankine-Hugoniot relations) turn out to be
inapplicable to Petschek's model owing to transient effects of thermal
conduction. The actual density enhancement can in fact exceed a factor of ten
over the entire reconnection outflow. An ensemble of flux tubes retracting
following reconnection at an ensemble of distinct sites will have a collective
emission measure proportional to the rate of flux tube production. This rate,
distinct from the local reconnection rate within a single tube, can be measured

galactic nuclei (AGNs). We examine the properties of infrared (IR) emission
from the inner edge of the dusty torus in AGNs, which are powered by super- or
sub-Eddington accretion flows around black holes, by considering the dependence
of the polar angle on the radiation flux of accretion flows (Watarai et al.
2005). We find that for super-Eddington AGNs, of which the mass accretion rate
is more than 10^2 times larger than the Eddington rate, the ratio of the AGN IR
luminosity and the disc bolometric luminosity is less than 10^-2, unless the
half opening angle of the torus (theta_torus) is small (theta_torus <65
degree). This is due to the self-occultation effect, whereby the
self-absorption at the outer region of the super-Eddington flow dilutes the
illumination of the torus. Such a small luminosity ratio is not observed in
sub-Eddington AGNs, whose mass accretion rate is comparable to or no more than
10 times larger than the Eddington mass accretion rate, except for extremely
thin tori (theta_torus >85 degree). We also consider the properties of the

luminosity, L_NIR,AGN/L_bol,disc, at least one order of magnitude smaller than
for sub-Eddington AGNs for a wide range of half opening angle (theta_torus > 65

addresses those topics by deriving steady-state solutions for clusters in which

electron thermal conduction to ~1/3 of the full Spitzer value, suggesting that

analytic description of the dynamical outcome for any collision between

impact parameters on collision outcome. During growth from planetesimals to
planets, collision outcomes span multiple regimes: cratering, merging,
disruption, super-catastrophic disruption, and hit-and-run events. We derive
equations (scaling laws) to demarcate the transition between collision regimes
and to describe the size and velocity distributions of the post-collision
bodies. The scaling laws are used to calculate maps of collision outcomes as a
function of mass ratio, impact angle, and impact velocity, and we discuss the
implications of the probability of each collision regime during planet

released through magnetic reconnection for a flare on 26 Feb 2004. This flare,
well observed by RHESSI and TRACE, shows evidence of non-thermal electrons only
for a brief, early phase. Throughout the main period of energy release there is
a super-hot (T>30 MK) plasma emitting thermal bremsstrahlung atop the flare
loops. Our model describes the heating and compression of such a source by
localized, transient magnetic reconnection. It is a three-dimensional
generalization of the Petschek model whereby Alfven-speed retraction following
reconnection drives supersonic inflows parallel to the field lines, which form
shocks heating, compressing, and confining a loop-top plasma plug. The
confining inflows provide longer life than a freely-expanding or
conductively-cooling plasma of similar size and temperature. Superposition of
successive transient episodes of localized reconnection across a current sheet
produces an apparently persistent, localized source of high-temperature
emission. The temperature of the source decreases smoothly on a time scale
consistent with observations, far longer than the cooling time of a single
plug. Built from a disordered collection of small plugs, the source need not
have the coherent jet-like structure predicted by steady-state reconnection
models. This new model predicts temperatures and emission measure consistent
with the observations of 26 Feb 2004. Furthermore, the total energy released by
the flare is found to be roughly consistent with that predicted by the model.
Only a small fraction of the energy released appears in the super-hot source at
any one time, but roughly a quarter of the flare energy is thermalized by the

parameters $L$ (texture characteristic length), $b_1$ and $b_2$ (local slip
lengths at solid and gas areas), and $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ (fractions of solid
and gas areas). Hydrodynamic properties of the plane are fully expressed in
terms of the effective slip-length tensor with eigenvalues that depend on
texture parameters and $H$ (local separation). The effect of effective slip is
predicted to decrease the force as compared with expected for two hydrophilic
surfaces and described by the Taylor equation. The presence of additional
length scales, $L$, $b_1$ and $b_2$, implies that a film drainage can be much
richer than in case of a sphere moving towards a hydrophilic plane. For a large
(compared to $L$) gap the reduction of the force is small, and for all textures
the force is similar to expected when a sphere is moving towards a smooth
hydrophilic plane that is shifted down from the super-hydrophobic wall. The
value of this shift is equal to the average of the eigenvalues of the
slip-length tensor. By analyzing striped super-hydrophobic surfaces, we then
compute the correction to the Taylor equation for an arbitrary gap. We show
that at thinner gap the force reduction becomes more pronounced, and that it
depends strongly on the fraction of the gas area and local slip lengths. For
small separations we derive an exact equation, which relates a correction for
effective slip to texture parameters. Our analysis provides a framework for

part of the local conductivity remains bounded below and above. Elementary
bounds on the effective moduli are derived assuming the local conductivity and
effective conductivity have transverse isotropy in the plane orthogonal to the

the restructuring with segregation of very broad super-radiant states and
trapping of remaining long-lived compound states. The appropriate formalism

Combining these new data, together with CARMA+NRO45 data for M51a and archival

investigate the empirical scaling law that connects the surface density of SFR
and cold gas (the Schmidt-Kennicutt law) on a spatially-resolved basis. We
argue that plausibly deriving SFR maps of nearby galaxies requires the diffuse
stellar/dust background emission to be carefully subtracted. An approach to
complete this task is presented and applied in our pixel-by-pixel analysis on
both galaxies, showing that the controversial results whether the molecular S-K
law is super-linear or basically linear is a result of removing or preserving
the local background. In both galaxies, the power index of the molecular S-K
law is 1.5-1.9 at the highest available resolution (230 pc), and decreases
monotonically for decreasing resolution; while the scatter (mainly intrinsic)
increases as the resolution becomes higher, indicating a trend for which the
S-K law breaks down below some scale. Both quantities are systematically larger
in M51a than in NGC 3521, but when plotted against the de-projected scale
(\delta_{dp}), they become highly consistent between the two galaxies,
tentatively suggesting that the sub-kpc molecular S-K law in spiral galaxies

In particular, even in critical situations where the conventional

This is just the condition for the existence of the event horizon. The

  magnetic fields",2011-01-11,Antonio L. Maroto,"In this work we consider quantum electromagnetic fields in an expanding
universe. We start by reviewing the difficulties found when trying to impose
the Lorenz condition in a time-dependent geometry. Motivated by this fact, we
explore the possibility of extending the electromagnetic theory by allowing the
scalar state which is usually eliminated by means of the Lorenz condition to
propagate, preserving at the same time the dynamics of ordinary transverse
photons. We show that the new state cannot be generated by charged currents,
but it breaks conformal invariance and can be excited gravitationally. In fact,
primordial quantum fluctuations produced during inflation can give rise to
super-Hubble temporal electromagnetic modes whose energy density behaves as a
cosmological constant. The value of the effective cosmological constant is
shown to agree with observations provided inflation took place at the
electroweak scale. The theory is compatible with all the local gravity tests
and is free from classical or quantum instabilities. Thus we see that, not only
the true nature of dark energy can be established without resorting to new
physics, but also the value of the cosmological constant finds a natural
explanation in the context of standard inflationary cosmology. On sub-Hubble
scales, the new state generates an effective charge density which, due to the
high electric conductivity of the cosmic plasma after inflation, gives rise to
both vorticity and magnetic fields. Present upper limits on vorticity coming
from CMB anisotropies are translated into lower limits on the present value of
cosmic magnetic fields. We find that magnetic fields $B_{\lambda}> 10^{-12}$ G

recent thermal evolution models of Super Earths (Gaidos et al. 2010; Tachinami

the evolution of the local Rossby number. This quantity is one of the proxies
for core magnetic field regime, i.e. non-reversing dipolar, reversing dipolar
and multipolar. We study the dependence of the local Rossby number and hence
the core magnetic field regime on planetary mass and rotation rate. Previous
works have focused only on the evolution of core magnetic fields assuming
rapidly rotating planets i.e. planets in the dipolar regime. In this work we go
further, including the effects of rotation in the evolution of planetary
magnetic field regime and obtaining global constraints to the existence of
intense protective magnetic fields in rapidly and slowly rotating Super Earths.
We find that the emergence and continued existence of a protective planetary
magnetic field is not only a function of planetary mass but also depend on
rotation rate. Low-mass Super Earths ($M\lesssim 2 M_\oplus$) develop intense
surface magnetic fields but their lifetimes will be limited to 2-4 Gyrs for
rotational periods larger than 1-4 days. On the other hand and also in the case

tomography, we consider how to incorporate the imperfections and restrictions
of available measurements directly into the quantification of entanglement.
Exploiting the idea that the recently introduced semiquantum nonlocal games as
the gauge of the amount of entanglement in a state, we define an effective
entanglement functional giving us effective entanglement when the measurement
operators one has at their disposal are restricted by either fundamental
considerations, such as superselection rules, or practical inability to conduct
precise measurements. We show that effective entanglement is always reduced by
restricting measurements. We define effective entanglement as the least amount
of entanglement necessary to play all semiquantum nonlocal games at least as
well with unrestricted measurements as with the more entangled original state
and restricted measurements. We show that simple linear relationship between
effective and conventional G-concurrence, generalization of concurrence, can be
obtained when completely positive maps are used to describe measurement
restrictions. We consider how typical measurement errors like photon loss and
phase damping degrade effective entanglement in quantum optical experiments, as
well as the impact of mass superselection rules on entanglement of massive
indistinguishable particles. The flexibility of the effective entanglement
formalism allows this single-particle entanglement to be calculated in the

planets in habitable zones, focusing on duration of dynamo activity to generate
their intrinsic magnetic fields, which may be one of key factors in
habitability on the planets. In particular, we are concerned with super-Earths,
observations of which are rapidly developing. We calculated evolution of
temperature distributions in planetary interior, using Vinet equations of
state, Arrhenius-type formula for mantle viscosity, and the astrophysical
mixing length theory for convective heat transfer modified for mantle
convection. After calibrating the model with terrestrial planets in the Solar
system, we apply it for 0.1--$10M_{\oplus}$ rocky planets with surface
temperature of $300~\mbox{K}$ (in habitable zones) and the Earth-like
compositions. With the criterion for heat flux at the CMB (core-mantle
boundary), the lifetime of the magnetic fields is evaluated from the calculated
thermal evolution. We found that the lifetime slowly increases with the
planetary mass ($M_p$) independent of initial temperature gap at the
core-mantle boundary ($\Delta T_{\rm CMB}$) but beyond a critical value
$M_{c,p}$ ($\sim O(1)M_{\oplus}$) it abruptly declines by the mantle viscosity
enhancement due to the pressure effect. We derived $M_{c,p}$ as a function of
$\Delta T_{\rm CMB}$ and a rheological parameter (activation volume, $V^*$).
Thus, the magnetic field lifetime of super-Earths with $M_p > M_{p,c}$
sensitively depends on $\Delta T_{\rm CMB}$, which reflects planetary
accretion, and $V^*$, which has uncertainty at very high pressure. More

expression of genes. They contain DNA binding domains which belong to several
super-families, each with a specific mechanism of DNA binding. The total number
of transcription factors encoded in a genome increases with the number of genes
in the genome. Here, we examined the number of transcription factors from each
super-family in diverse organisms.
  We find that the number of transcription factors from most super-families
appears to be bounded. For example, the number of winged helix factors does not
generally exceed 300, even in very large genomes. The magnitude of the maximal
number of transcription factors from each super-family seems to correlate with
the number of DNA bases effectively recognized by the binding mechanism of that
super-family. Coding theory predicts that such upper bounds on the number of
transcription factors should exist, in order to minimize cross-binding errors
between transcription factors. This theory further predicts that factors with
similar binding sequences should tend to have similar biological effect, so
that errors based on mis-recognition are minimal. We present evidence that
transcription factors with similar binding sequences tend to regulate genes
with similar biological functions, supporting this prediction.

researchers in the field abandoned the term ""cooling flow clusters"" in favor of
the name ""cool core clusters"". This change, I argue, has been causing damage by
promoting the view that there is no substantial cooling in these clusters. In
this contribution I discuss the following points, with emphasize on the last
one that deals with magnetic fields in cooling flow clusters. (1) Both
AGN-feedback and hot-gas cooling to form stars occur during galaxy formation as
well as in cooling flow clusters. Ignoring cooling of the intra-cluster medium,
as implied by the term ""cool core"", does not encourage comparative study of AGN
feedback in cooling flow clusters with that of galaxy formation. (2) The line
of thought that there is no cooling might lead to wrong questions and research
directions. (3) A key question in both cooling flow clusters and during galaxy
formation is the mode of accretion by the super massive black hole (SMBH). When
cooling is neglected only accretion from the hot phase remains. Accretion from
the hot phase, such as the Bondi accretion, suffers from some severe problems.
(4) When it is accepted that moderate quantities of gas are cooling, it becomes
clear that global heat conduction must be substantially suppressed. This does
not favor a globally ordered magnetic field. As well, it makes global heat
conduction unattractive.",astro-ph.CO,cat:quant-ph,all:super%20conducting

super-Earths, with mass and period up to ~ 20 M_E and a few months, are more
common than those with Jupiter-mass gas giants. In many cases, these
super-Earths are members of multiple-planet systems in which their mutual
dynamical interaction has influenced their formation and evolution. In this
paper, we modify an existing numerical population synthesis scheme to take into
account protoplanetary embryos' interaction with their evolving natal gaseous
disk, as well as their close scatterings and resonant interaction with each
other. We show that it is possible for a group of compact embryos to emerge
interior to the ice line, grow, migrate, and congregate into closely-packed
convoys which stall in the proximity of their host stars. After the disk-gas
depletion, they undergo orbit crossing, close scattering, and giant impacts to
form multiple rocky Earths or super-Earths in non-resonant orbits around ~
0.1AU with moderate eccentricities of ~0.01-0.1. We suggest that most
refractory super-Earths with period in the range of a few days to weeks may

disk before the dust particles spiral to the central star is one of the most
challenging problems in the theory of planetary system formation. In our

profile that consists of both super and sub-Keplerian regions is created in the
disk through non-uniform excitation of Magneto-Rotational Instability (MRI).
Such non-uniform MRI excitation is reasonably expected in a part of disks with
relatively low ionization degree. In this paper, we show through
three-dimensional resistive MHD simulations with test particles that this
radial structure of the angular velocity indeed leads to prevention of
spiral-in of dust particles and furthermore to their accumulation at the
boundary of super-Keplerian and sub-Keplerian regions. Treating dust particles
as test particles, their motions under the influence of the non-uniform MRI
through gas drag are simulated. In the most favorable cases (meter-size dust
particles in the disk region with a relatively large fraction of MRI-stable
region), we found that the dust concentration is peaked around the
super/sub-Keplerian flow boundary and the peak dust density is 10,000 times as
high as the initial value. The peak density is high enough for the subsequent

northern sky. It has been revealed as an interesting source where to study
extreme relativistic jet phenomena. However, its cosmological distance has not
been reported so far, because of its optical faintness produced by strong
Galactic extinction.
  Aims. Aiming at measuring the redshift of NRAO 150, and hence to start making
possible quantitative studies from the source.
  Methods. We have conducted spectroscopic and photometric observations of the
source in the near-IR, as well as in the optical.
  Results. All such observations have been successful in detecting the source.
The near-IR spectroscopic observations reveal strong H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$
emission lines from which the cosmological redshift of NRAO 150
($z=1.517\pm0.002$) has been determined for the first time. We classify the
source as a flat-spectrum radio-loud quasar, for which we estimate a large
super-massive black-hole mass $\sim5\times 10^{9} \mathrm{M_\odot}$. After
extinction correction, the new near-IR and optical data have revealed a
high-luminosity continuum-emission excess in the optical (peaking at
$\sim2000$\,\AA, rest frame) that we attribute to thermal emission from the
accretion disk for which we estimate a high accretion rate, $\sim30$\,% of the
Eddington limit.
  Conclusions. Comparison of these source properties, and its broad-band
spectral-energy distribution, with those of Fermi blazars allow us to predict
that NRAO 150 is among the most powerful blazars, and hence a high luminosity

transitioned quickly from active accretion to quiescence, with the luminosity
dropping by over 3 orders of magnitude in ~13 days. The spectra obtained during
quiescence exhibit both a thermal component, presumed to originate in emission
from the NS surface, and a non-thermal component of uncertain origin, which has
shown large and irregular variability. We interpret the observed decay of the
inferred effective surface temperature of the NS in quiescence as the cooling
of the NS crust after having been heated and brought out of thermal equilibrium
with the core during the outburst. The interpretation of the data is
complicated by an apparent temporary increase in temperature ~220 days into
quiescence, possibly due to an additional spurt of accretion. We derive an
exponential decay timescale of ~120 (+30/-20) days for the inferred temperature
(excluding observations affected by the temporary increase). This short
timescale indicates a highly conductive NS crust. Further observations are
needed to confirm whether the crust is still slowly cooling or has already
reached thermal equilibrium with the core at a surface temperature of ~125 eV.

optical Kubo sum rule in the cuprates. We compute conductivities, optical
integrals W, and \Delta W between superconducting and normal states for 2-D
systems with lattice dispersion typical of the cuprates for four different
models -- a dirty BCS model, a single Einstein boson model, a marginal Fermi
liquid model, and a collective boson model with a feedback from
super-conductivity on a collective boson. The goal of the paper is two-fold.
First, we analyze the dependence of W on the upper cut-off w_c placed on the
optical integral because in experiments W is measured up to frequencies of
order bandwidth. For a BCS model, the Kubo sum rule is almost fully reproduced
at w_c equal to the bandwidth. But for other models only 70%-80% of Kubo sum
rule is obtained up to this scale and even less so for \Delta W, implying that
the Kubo sum rule has to be applied with caution. Second, we analyze the sign
of \Delta W. In all models we studied \Delta W is positive at small w_c, then
crosses zero and approaches a negative value at large w_c, i.e. the optical
integral in a superconductor is smaller than in a normal state. The point of
zero crossing, however, increases with the interaction strength and in a
collective boson model becomes comparable to the bandwidth at strong coupling.

debated. Currently, the favoured model involves the accumulation of meter-sized
objects within a turbulent disc, followed by a phase of gravitational
instability. At best one can simulate a few million particles numerically as
opposed to the several trillion meter-sized particles expected in a real
protoplanetary disc. Therefore, single particles are often used as
super-particles to represent a distribution of many smaller particles. It is
assumed that small scale phenomena do not play a role and particle collisions
are not modeled. The super-particle approximation can only be valid in a
collisionless or strongly collisional system, however, in many recent numerical
simulations this is not the case.
  In this work we present new results from numerical simulations of
planetesimal formation via gravitational instability. A scaled system is
studied that does not require the use of super-particles. We find that the
scaled particles can be used to model the initial phases of clumping if the
properties of the scaled particles are chosen such that all important
timescales in the system are equivalent to what is expected in a real
protoplanetary disc. Constraints are given for the number of particles needed
in order to achieve numerical convergence.
  We compare this new method to the standard super-particle approach. We find
that the super-particle approach produces unreliable results that depend on

radius, assuming the planet does not contain significant amounts of water or
gas. We show that the strength of the limits that can be placed on a
super-Earth's composition depends on the planet's density; for similar
observational uncertainties, high-density super-Mercuries allow the tightest
composition constraints. Finally, we describe how techniques from Bayesian
statistics can be used to take into account in a formal way the combined
contributions of both theoretical and observational uncertainties to
ambiguities in a planet's interior composition. On the whole, with only a mass
and radius measurement an exact interior composition cannot be inferred for an
exoplanet because the problem is highly underconstrained. Detailed quantitative

of three coupled quantum dots weakly connected to external magnetic leads. In
particular, using the diagrammatic technique on the Keldysh contour, we
calculate the conductance, shot noise and tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) in the
sequential and cotunneling regimes. We show that transport characteristics
greatly depend on the strength of the interdot Coulomb correlations, which
determines the spacial distribution of electron wave function in the chain.
When the correlations are relatively strong, depending on the transport regime,
we find both negative TMR as well as TMR enhanced above the Julliere value,
accompanied with negative differential conductance (NDC) and super-Poissonian
shot noise. This nontrivial behavior of tunnel magnetoresistance is associated
with selection rules that govern tunneling processes and various high-spin
states of the chain that are relevant for transport. For weak interdot
correlations, on the other hand, the TMR is always positive and not larger than
the Julliere TMR, although super-Poissonian shot noise and NDC can still be

different electron systems. In this investigation we present more detail on
these new findings. Based on the Ambegaokar-Eckern-Schoen (AES) theory of the
Coulomb blockade we introduce a general response theory that probes the
sensitivity of SET to changes in the boundary conditions. This response theory
defines a new set of physical observables and we establish the contact with the
standard results obtained from ordinary linear response theory. The response
parameters generally define the renormalization behavior of the SET in the
entire regime from weak coupling with large values of the tunneling conductance
all the way down to the strong coupling phase where the system displays the
Coulomb blockade. We introduce a general criterion for charge quantization that
is analogous to the Thouless criterion for Anderson localization. We present
the results of detailed computations on the weak coupling side of the theory,
i.e. both perturbative and non-perturbative (instantons). Based on an effective
theory in terms of quantum spins we study the quantum critical behavior of the

However, these past studies failed to take into consideration the role that
tides may play in this system. Even if the planet's eccentricity has always
been zero, we show that tidal decay of semi-major axis could have been large
enough that the planet formed on a wider orbit which received less insolation.
Moreover, CoRoT-7 b could be tidally heated at a rate that dominates its
geophysics and drives extreme volcanism. In this case, CoRoT-7 b is a

particles in the limit of small super-saturation. The new element is an

The effective initial condition is characterized by a narrow distribution of
cluster-sizes, all much larger than critical. In the subsequent solution, one
of the LS similarity solutions emerges as the long-time limit, as expected. But
our solution tells more. In particular, there is a ""growth"" era prior to what
is usually called ""coarsening"". During ""growth"" the clusters (all of nearly the
same size much larger than critical) eventually exhaust the super-saturation
(the exhaustion of nucleation in the previous era results from only a small
decrease in super-saturation). This allows the critical size to catch up to the
clusters, and the traditional ""coarsening"" begins: Subcritical clusters
dissolve and fuel the growth of the remaining super-critical clusters. Our
analysis tracks the evolution of cluster sizes during growth and coarsening by
complimentary use of asymptotic and numerical methods. We establish
characteristic times and cluster sizes associated with growth and coarsening
from physical parameters and the initial super-saturation. The emerging
distribution is discontinuous at the largest cluster size, and our model

all tree amplitudes in N=4 SYM theory. In addition to the choice of a reference
spinor, this super MHV vertex expansion also depends on four reference
Grassmann parameters. We demonstrate that a significant fraction of diagrams in
the expansion vanishes for a judicious choice of these Grassmann parameters,
which simplifies the computation of amplitudes. Even pure-gluon amplitudes
require fewer diagrams than in the ordinary MHV vertex expansion.
  We show that the super MHV vertex expansion arises from the recursion
relation associated with a holomorphic all-line supershift. This is a
supersymmetric generalization of the holomorphic all-line shift recently
introduced in arXiv:0811.3624. We study the large-z behavior of generating
functions under these all-line supershifts, and find that they generically
provide 1/z^k falloff at (Next-to)^k MHV level. In the case of anti-MHV
generating functions, we find that a careful choice of shift parameters

non-supersymmetric version of the model and the fine-tuning of the initial
conditions of the fields leading to sufficient inflation to account for the
standard cosmological problems. They are investigated by studying the exact
two-fields dynamics instead of assuming slow-roll. When the field values are
restricted to be less than the reduced Planck mass, a non-negligible part of
the initial condition space (around 15% depending on potential parameters)
leads to successful inflation. Most of it is located outside the usual
inflationary valley and organized in continuous patterns instead of being
isolated as previously found. Their existence is explained and their properties
are studied. This shows that no excessive fine-tuning is required for
successful hybrid inflation. Moreover, by extending the initial condition space
to planckian-like or super-planckian values, inflation becomes generically
sufficiently long and can produce a red-tilted scalar power spectrum due to
slow-roll violations. The robustness of these properties is confirmed by

hydrogen-rich atmospheres. Others might never accumulate hydrogen or experience
significant escape of lightweight elements, resulting in atmospheres more like
those of the terrestrial planets in our Solar System. We examine how an
observer could differentiate between hydrogen-rich and hydrogen-poor
atmospheres by modeling super-Earth emission and transmission spectra, and we
find that discrimination is possible by observing the transmission spectrum
alone. An Earth-like atmosphere, composed of mostly heavy elements and
molecules, will have a very weak transmission signal due to its small
atmospheric scale height (since the scale height is inversely proportional to
molecular weight). On the other hand, a large hydrogen-rich atmosphere reveals
a relatively large transmission signal. The super Earth emission spectrum can
additionally contrain the atmospheric composition and temperature structure.
Super-Earths with massive hydrogen atmospheres will reveal strong spectral
features due to water, whereas those that have lost most of their hydrogen (and
have no liquid ocean) will be marked by CO$_2$ features and a lack of H$_2$O.

Between 1.8 and 10 K a high-field magnetoresistance with large amplitude and a

magnetic field/temperature ratio. Its origin is attributed to the presence of
paramagnetic states present at the surface or between the nanoparticles. Below

tunnelling magnetoresistance is observed, the amplitude of which does not

in the SU(2)U(1) standard model of the electro-weak interactions and the

Embedding SU(2)U(1) into the Lie super-algebra SU(2/1) fills these gaps. The 2
smallest representations of SU(2/1) adequately describe the electron, neutrino,
up and down quarks and correlate their chiralities with their U(1) charges, and
the Higgs fields have the quantum numbers of the odd generators. But so far,
there was an apparent conflict with unitarity, because the quark representation
is not Hermitian and the super-Killing metric is not positive definite. We
solve this paradox by assuming the existence of 2 complex Higgs doublets
minimally coupled to the Fermions via the chiral projections of the odd
generators of SU(2/1). We find that Lagrangian induced by the Fermion loops is
unitary, thanks to the balance between the leptons and the quarks needed to
cancel the triangle anomaly and that the super-Jacobi identity guarantees that
the photon remains massless after symmetry breaking. In addition, the
Lagrangian has a classical geometric interpretation in terms of the curvature
of the corresponding Hermitian algebra. Assuming that the relative strength of
the scalar and vector couplings does not depend on the number of families
constrains the mass of the Higgs to $M^2_{H^0_1} + M^2_{H^0_2} = 32/9 M^2_W = 2

  Giants",2008-02-01,Douglas N. C. Lin,"Based on the conventional sequential-accretion paradigm, we have proposed
that, during the migration of first-born gas giants outside the orbits of
planetary embryos, super Earth planets will form inside the 2:1 resonance
location by sweeping of mean motion resonances (Zhou et al. 2005). In this
paper, we study the subsequent evolution of a super Earth (m_1) under the
effects of tidal dissipation and perturbation from a first-born gas giant (m_2)
in an outside orbit. Secular perturbation and mean motion resonances
(especially 2:1 and 5:2 resonances) between m_1 and m_2 excite the eccentricity
of m_1, which causes the migration of m_1 and results in a hot super Earth. The
calculated final location of the hot super Earth is independent of the tidal
energy dissipation factor Q'. The study of migration history of a Hot Super
Earth is useful to reveal its Q' value and to predict its final location in the
presence of one or more hot gas giants. When this investigation is applied to
the GJ876 system, it correctly reproduces the observed location of GJ876d

of corrections is to cancel unphysical singularities generically present in

photonic band gap structures in the context of negative refraction and
super-resolution in the visible and near infrared ranges. In the resonance
tunneling regime, we find that for transverse-magnetic incident polarization,
field localization effects contribute to a waveguiding phenomenon that makes it
possible for the light to remain confined within a small fraction of a
wavelength, without any transverse boundaries, due to the suppression of
diffraction. This effect is related to negative refraction of the Poynting
vector inside each metal layer, balanced by normal refraction inside the
adjacent dielectric layer: The degree of field localization and material
dispersion together determine the total momentum that resides within any given
layer, and thus the direction of energy flow. We find that the transport of
evanescent wave vectors is mediated by the excitation of quasi-stationary, low
group velocity surface waves responsible for relatively large losses. As
representative examples we consider transparent metallo-dielectric stacks such
as Ag/TiO2 and Ag/GaP and show in detail how to obtain the optimum conditions
for high transmittance of both propagating and evanescent modes for
super-guiding and super resolution applications across the visible and near IR

propagate around the corotation, where the wave pattern rotation speed equals
the fluid rotation rate. Waves incident upon the corotation barrier may be
super-reflected (commonly referred to as corotation amplifier), but the
reflection can be strongly affected by wave absorptions at the corotation
resonance/singularity. The sign of the absorption is related to the Rossby wave
zone very near the corotation radius. We derive the explicit expressions for
the complex reflection and transmission coefficients, taking into account wave
absorption at the corotation resonance. We show that for generic discs, this
absorption plays a much more important role than wave transmission across the
corotation barrier. Depending on the sign of the gradient of the specific
vorticity of the disc the corotation resonance can either enhance or diminish
the super-reflectivity, and this can be understood in terms of the location of
the Rossby wave zone relative to the corotation radius. Our results provide the
explicit conditions (in terms of disc thickness, rotation profile and specific
vorticity gradient) for which super-reflection can be achieved. Global

power law photon index over the pulse period was identified, similar to that
observed from other X-ray pulsars. If this variability is real it can be
attributed to a varying viewing geometry of the accretion region with the spin
of the neutron star. Variability of the neutral hydrogen column density over
the orbital period was observed, which we attribute to the line of sight motion
of the neutron star through the dense circumstellar environment. A reduction in
the power law photon index was observed during the orbital maximum, which we
speculate is due to absorption effects as the neutron star passes behind a
heavily absorbing region near the base of the supergiant companion's wind. No
significant variability of the column density was observed over the
super-orbital period, indicating that variable obscuration by a precessing warp
in an accretion disc is not the mechanism behind the super-orbital modulation.
In contrast, a significant increase in the power law photon index was observed

Many of them are predominantly devoid of active star formation and for now they
represent the earliest observed stages of massive star formation. Their Outer
Galaxy counterparts, if present, are not easily identified because of a low or
absent mid-IR background. We characterize the ambient conditions in the Outer
Galaxy IRDC candidate G111.80+0.58, a relatively quiescent molecular core
complex in the vicinity of NGC7538. We conduct molecular line observations on a
number of dense cores and analyze the data in terms of excitation temperature,
column and volume density, mass and stability. The temperatures (15-20K) are
higher than expected from only cosmic ray heating, but comparable to those
found in massive cores. Star forming activity could be present in some cores,
as indicated by the presence of warm gas and YSO candidates. The observed
super-thermal line-widths are typical for star forming regions. The velocity
dispersion is consistent with a turbulent energy cascade over the observed size
scales. We do not find a correlation between the gas temperature and the
line-width. The LTE masses we find are much larger than the thermal Jeans mass
and fragmentation is expected. In that case the observed lines represent the
combined emission of multiple unresolved components. We conclude that
G111.80+0.58 is a molecular core complex with bulk properties very similar to
IRDCs in an early, but not pristine, star forming state. The individual cores

size as follows: i) For constant W/L, it remains constant as size is increased,
at a value which depends almost lineally on that ratio; this scaling allows the
definition of a conductivity value that results similar to the experimental
one. ii) For fixed width, the conductance decreases exponentially with length
L, both for ordered and disordered samples. Disorder reduces the exponential
decay, leading to a higher conductance. iii) For constant length, conductance
increases linearly with width W, a result that is exclusively due to the tails

at the second harmonic. The SNO D2O dataset shows weak modulation at that

bottom of its mantle first, and then are gradually sequestered to its liquid
metal core. Earth is rich in oxidative volatiles including water, therefore, U
and Th in the core can be moved up by an internal circulation system consisting
of the outer core, hot super plumes, asthenosphere and subduction zone (or cold
super plumes). This internal circulation system is the key for the formation of
plate tectonics, the geodynamo and the consequent geomagnetic field. Moreover,
plentiful oxidative volatiles and water within Earth is the precondition to
form such a circulation system. In the early stage (> 4 Ga), Mars developed an
Earth-like internal circulation system due to relatively large amount of
oxidative volatile compositions coming from its building material. This would
have produced a dynamo and correspondingly an Earth-like magnetic field.
However, this internal circulation system was destroyed by one or several giant

These events also shaped the striking hemispheric dichotomy structure on the

  Several simulations of supernova remnants are presented for a range of ISM

We find that thermal conduction produces cooler temperatures and higher
densities in the hot gas bubbles that form in the remnants. The effect of
thermal conduction in changing the thermal characteristics of the hot gas
bubble increases as the remnant propagates through denser ISMs. Remnants
evolving in denser ISMs are shown to make a faster transition to a

compressibility. The strongly magnetized layer will thermally isolate the two
media and may contribute to the Kelvin-Helmholtz stability of the interface.

molecules weakly coupled to one ferromagnetic and one nonmagnetic lead. We find
that the current is suppressed over wide voltage ranges due to spin blockade.
In this system, spin blockade is associated with successive spin flips of the
molecular spins and depends on the anisotropy energy barrier. This leads to the
appearance of a window of bias voltages between the Coulomb blockade and spin
blockade regimes where the current is large and to negative differential
conductance at low temperatures. Remarkably, negative differential conductance
is also present close to room temperature. Spin-blockade behavior is
accompanied by super-Poissonian shot noise, like in nonmagnetic quantum dots.
Finally, we show that the charge transmitted through the molecule between
initial preparation in a certain spin state and infinite time very strongly

molecule can act as a spin-charge converter, an effect potentially useful as a

simulations include metal dependent radiative cooling, star formation according
to different IMFs, energy feedback as strong starburst-driven galactic

  In general, models with efficient super-winds, along with a top-heavy stellar
IMF, are able to reproduce fairly well the observed $L_X-T$ relation, the
entropy profiles and the cold fraction. Observed radial ICM temperature
profiles can be matched, except for the gradual decline in temperature inside

higher than the mean density of rich Abell clusters previously observed at

In a small sample of atoms, the emitted light can be switched from sub- to

mean number of atoms in the sample. Larger samples allow to generate
super-bunched light over a wide range of bath parameters and thus fluorescence
light intensities. We also identify parameter ranges where the fields emitted

observation that the fermions of the continuum theory can be mapped into the
component fields of a single real anticommuting Kahler-Dirac field. The
original supersymmetry algebra then implies the existence of a nilpotent scalar
supercharge $Q$ and a corresponding set of bosonic superpartners. Using this
field content we write down a $Q$-exact action and show that, with an
appropriate change of variables, it reduces to a well-known twist of ${\cal

identified by no arbitrage arguments. However, the ``classical'' super
replication price is a sensible indicator of the (maximum selling) value of the
claim. When f satisfies certain pointwise conditions (e.g., f is bounded from
below), the super replication price is equal to sup_QE_Q[f], where Q varies on
the whole set of pricing measures. Unfortunately, this price is often too high:
a typical situation is here discussed in the examples. We thus define the less
expensive weak super replication price and we relax the requirements on f by
asking just for ``enough'' integrability conditions. By building up a proper
duality theory, we show its economic meaning and its relation with the
investor's preferences. Indeed, it turns out that the weak super replication
price of f coincides with sup_{Q\in M_{\Phi}}E_Q[f], where M_{\Phi} is the

different methods to a standardized problem. The key difference between the
various methods rests in the amount of information that each processes. A
Lomb-Scargle analysis that uses the mid times of the time bins and ignores
experimental error estimates uses the least information. A likelihood analysis
that uses the start times, end times, and mean live times, and takes account of
the experimental error estimates, makes the greatest use of the available
information. We carry out power-spectrum analyses of the Super-Kamiokande 5-day
solar neutrino data, using each method in turn, for a standard search band (0
to 50 yr-1). For each method, we also carry out a fixed number (10,000) of
Monte-Carlo simulations for the purpose of estimating the significance of the
leading peak in each power spectrum. We find that, with one exception, the
results of these calculations are compatible with those of previously published
analyses. (We are unable to replicate Koshio's recent results.) We find that

At variance with other suggestions in the literature, our results indicate that
the peaks in the Au conductance histograms are not a simple consequence of
conductance quantization or the existence of exceptionally stable radii. We
show that the main peak in the histogram close to one quantum of conductance is

growth above may be larger by order(s) of magnitude. In contrast, the growth
factor expected in sub-Eddington phase is only ~ 2. Therefore, the cosmic BH

mass and the width at the half maximum of H$\beta$ for active galactic nuclei
(AGNs) with super-Eddington accretion rates. When a black hole has a
super-Eddington accretion rate, the empirical relation of reverberation mapping
has two possible ways. First, it reduces to a relation between the black hole
mass and the size of the broad line region due to the photon trapping effects
inside the accretion disk. For the Kaspi et al.'s empirical reverberation
relation, we get the limit relation as $M_{\rm BH}=(2.9 - 12.6)\times
10^6M_{\odot} (\upsilon_{\rm FWHM}/10^3{\rm km s^{-1}})^{6.67}$, called as the
Eddington limit. Second, the Eddington limit luminosity will be relaxed if the
trapped photons can escape from the magnetized super-Eddington accretion disk
via the photon bubble instability, and the size of the broad line region will
be enlarged according to the empirical reverberation relation, leading to a
relatively narrow width of H$\beta$. We call this the Begelman limit.
  Super-Eddington accretions in a sample composed of 164 AGNs have been
searched by this limit relation. We find there are a handful of objects locate
between the Eddington and Begelman limit lines, they may be candidates of
super-Eddington accretors in a hybrid structure of photon trapping and photon
bubble instability. The maximum width of H$\beta$ is in the reange of $(3.0 -
3.8)\times 10^3$ km s$^{-1}$ for the maximum mass black holes with
super-Eddington accretion rates among AGNs. We suggest that this limit relation

We find unequivocal evidence for a huge (at least 80 x 80 x 100 Mpc^3)
super-structure at redshift z=0.27, confirming tentative evidence for such a
structure from the 7C redshift survey (7CRS). A second, newly discovered
super-structure is also tentatively found at redshift 0.35 (of dimensions at
least 100 x 100 x 100 Mpc^3). Out of the total sample size of 84 radio
galaxies, at least 25 are associated with the two super-structures. We use
quasi-linear structure formation theory to estimate the number of such
structures expected in the TONS08 volume if the canonical value for radio
galaxy bias is assumed. Under this assumption, the structures represent ~ 4-5
sigma peaks in the primordial density field and their expected number is low
(10^{-2}-10^{-4}). Fortunately, there are several plausible explanations (many
of which are testable) for these low probabilities in the form of potential
mechanisms for boosting the bias on large scales. These include: the
association of radio galaxies with highly biased rich clusters in
super-structures, enhanced triggering by group/group mergers, and enhanced
triggering and/or redshift space distortion in collapsing systems as the growth
of super-structures moves into the non-linear regime. Similar structures could
have been missed in previous surveys because of the effects of Poisson-sampling
fluctuations.",astro-ph,cat:quant-ph,all:super%20conducting

  Natural Orbital analysis of strongly correlated ground and excited states of

Bose, of a dilute gas of atoms being condensed into a single quantum state was
experimentally achieved in 1995 following decades of research. An avalanche of
experiment and theory has followed, leading to the awarding of the 2001 Nobel
Prizes in Physics to three of the pioneering experimentalists. Theory, mostly
couched in the language and formalism of condensed matter physics, has
developed apace. What we point out here is that a condensate in a double well
trap may be thought of exactly as a diatomic molecule with delocalized
molecular orbitals (MOs) filled with Bosons, rather than electrons. As in
quantum chemistry, configuration interaction must be included to supplement the
MO picture if dissociation is to be correctly described. Such dissociation is
called condensate fragmentation in the condensed matter theory literature.
Natural orbitals and their occupation numbers provide a clear and succinct way
of determining where the atoms are in highly correlated states as fragmentation
occurs, and are particularly helpful in understanding what is actually
happening when energy levels with macroscopic occupancy cross as a function of
breaking the symmetry between the trap wells. It is seen that only a few
particles are actually active in the level crossing. Recent experiments in
super-conductive Josephson loops showing tunneling of macroscopic quantum
states are easily included in this picture.",cond-mat,cat:quant-ph,all:super%20conducting

a high energy cut-off power-law with a photon index in the range of 0.7-1.0 and
an iron emission line. In the low state, the spectrum is found to be flatter

detected between the continuum flux in 7-25 keV energy band and the iron
emission line flux. The equivalent width of the iron emission line is found to
be highly variable during low intensity state, whereas it remains almost
constant during the high intensity state of the super-orbital period. It is
observed that the spectral variations in LMC X-4 are similar to those of Her

form jets by carrying out 3D axisymmetric quasi-stationary MHD calculations

inconsistency with the present model photospheres which predict H2O only in the

Stratoscope II. This discovery was so unexpected at that time that it was not
understood correctly and overlooked for a long time. Now, we reflect on our
ignorance of this important discovery during the 40 years and should consider
more seriously the meaning of the rediscovery of water in so many red

early M supergiant mu Cep as well as in late M giants with ISO, H2O should be
in the outer atmosphere rather than in the photosphere. We propose that the
absorption as well as emission of H2O should be originating in a new component,

the heat that is conducted from the burning layer in large part flows inward,

representation theoretic point of view. This leads us to a generalization
expressed in terms of quantum groups and braided categories. It also unifies
the conventional concept of symmetry with that of exchange statistics and the
spin-statistics relation. We show how this quantum group symmetry is
reconstructed from the traditional (super) group symmetry, statistics and
spin-statistics relation.
  The old question of extending the Poincare group to unify external and
internal symmetries (solved by supersymmetry) is reexamined in the new
framework. The reason why we should allow supergroups in this case becomes
completely transparent. However, the true symmetries are not expressed by
groups or supergroups here but by ordinary (not super) quantum groups. We show
in this generalized framework that supersymmetry remains the most general
unification of internal and space-time symmetries provided that all particles

analyze the two components A1 and A2 of the brightest super star cluster NGC

presence of Wolf-Rayet stars and red supergiants. The FOS spectra provide the
first evidence for O-stars in NGC 1569-A, indicating a young (5 Myr) stellar

history of the cosmic expansion and star formation, and provide important
information on their progenitor models. At present, however, there are few
observational constraints on the abundance of SNe at high redshifts. A major
science driver for the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) is the study of
such very distant supernovae. In this paper we discuss strategies for finding
and counting distant SNe by using repeat imaging of super-critical intermediate
redshift clusters whose mass distributions are well-constrained via modelling
of strongly-lensed features. For a variety of different models for the star
formation history and supernova progenitors, we estimate the likelihood of
detecting lensed SNe as a function of their redshift. In the case of a survey
conducted with HST, we predict a high probability of seeing a supernova in a
single return visit with either WFPC-2 or ACS, and a much higher probability of
detecting examples with z>1 in the lensed case. Most events would represent
magnified SNe II at z~1, and a fraction will be more distant examples. We
discuss various ways to classify such events using ground-based infrared
photometry. We demonstrate an application of the method using the HST archival

fundamentally determined by the renormalizability of the theory. The
construction of an epsilon-expansion in direct analogy with the
phase-transition theory gives rise to the problem of a `spurious' pole. To
solve this problem, a proper treatment of the factorial divergency of the
perturbation series is necessary. Simplifications arising in high dimensions

known AGN in the local (z<0.3) Universe, the recently discovered quasar PDS
456. Multiwavelength observations have been conducted which show that PDS 456
has a bolometric luminosity of 10^47 erg/s peaking in the UV part of the
spectrum. In the X-ray band the 2-10 keV (rest-frame) luminosity is 10^45
erg/s. The broad-band X-ray spectrum obtained with ASCA and RXTE contains
considerable complexity. The most striking feature observed is a very deep,
ionised iron K edge, observed at 8.7 keV in the quasar rest-frame. We find that
these features are consistent with reprocessing from highly ionised matter,
probably the inner accretion disk. PDS 456 appeared to show a strong (factor of
2.1) outburst in just 17ksec, although non-intrinsic sources cannot be
completely ruled out. If confirmed, this would be an unusual event for such a
high-luminosity source, with the light-crossing-time corresponding to 2
Schwarzschild radii. The implication would be that flaring occurs within the
very central regions, or else that PDS 456 is a `super-Eddington' or
relativistically beamed system. Overall we conclude on the basis of the extreme
blue/UV luminosity, the rapid X-ray variability and from the imprint of highly

then investigate a scenario (based on the Shlosman-Noguchi model) in which the

massive gaseous clumps. Since these clumps are exposed to the external high
pressure driven by the superwind (a blast wave driven by a collective effect of
a large number of supernovae in the very core of the galaxy), they can collapse

and surface tension interacting with a central black hole is studied. A careful
investigation of all classical solutions reveals that the value of the radius
of the shell and of the radial velocity as an initial datum does not determine
the motion of the shell; another configuration space must, therefore, be found.
A different problem is that the shell Hamiltonians used in literature are
complicated functions of momenta (non-local) and they are gauge dependent. To
solve these problems, the existence is proved of a gauge invariant
super-Hamiltonian that is quadratic in momenta and that generates the shell
equations of motion. The true Hamiltonians are shown to follow from the
super-Hamiltonian by a reduction procedure including a choice of gauge and
solution of constraint; one important step in the proof is a lemma stating that
the true Hamiltonians are uniquely determined (up to a canonical
transformation) by the equations of motion of the shell, the value of the total
energy of the system, and the choice of time coordinate along the shell. As an
example, the Kraus-Wilczek Hamiltonian is rederived from the super-Hamiltonian.
The super-Hamiltonian coincides with that of a fictitious particle moving in a

factor of 1000 and have been persuasively associated with compact objects.
Here, a model of super-Eddington radiation transfer on the surface of a
strongly magnetic ($\geq 10^{13}$ gauss) neutron star is studied and related to
the observational constraints on soft gamma repeaters. In strong magnetic
fields, the cross-section to electron scattering is strongly suppressed in one
polarization state, so super-Eddington fluxes can be radiated while the plasma
remains in hydrostatic equilibrium. The model offers a somewhat natural
explanation for the observation of similarity between spectra from bursts of
varying intensity. The radiation produced in the model is found to be linearly
polarized to about 1 part in 1000 in a direction determined by the local
magnetic field, and the large intensity variations between bursts are
understood as a change in the radiating area on the source. Therefore, the
polarization may vary as a function of burst intensity, since the complex
structure of the magnetic field may be more apparent for larger radiating
areas. It is shown that for radiation transfer calculations in this limit of
super-strong magnetic fields it is sufficient to solve the radiation transfer
